anything that is when he is wisdom the maker of the worlds who brings all things to fulfillment and recreates all things who is the end of all that has come into being 6 irenaeus represents another minor patristic tradition which identified the spirit of god and not christ himself as wisdom 7 he could appeal to paul s teaching about wisdom being one of the gifts of the holy spirit 1 corinthians

holy wisdom is understood as the divine logos who became incarnate as jesus 8 this belief being sometimes also expressed in some eastern orthodox icons 9 in the divine liturgy of the orthodox church the exclamation sophia or in english wisdom will be proclaimed by the deacon or priest at certain moments especially before the reading of scripture to draw the congregation s attention to sacred teaching there is a hagiographical tradition dating to the late sixth century 10 of a saint sophia and her three daughters saints faith hope and charity this has been taken as the veneration of allegorical figures from an early time and the group of saints has become popular in russian orthodox iconography as such the names of the daughters rendered as \u0432\u0463\u0440\u0430

wisdom i e wisdom as a person of the trinity christian mysticism edit in russian orthodox mysticism sophia became increasingly indistinguishable from the person of the theotokos rather than christ to the point of the implication of the theotokos as a fourth person of the trinity such interpretations became popular in the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries forwarded by authors such as vladimir solovyov pavel florensky nikolai berdyaev and sergei bulgakov bulgakov s theology known as sophianism presented divine wisdom as consubstantiality of the holy trinity operating as the aspect of consubstantiality ousia or physis substantia or natura or hypostaticity of the trinity of the three hypostases the father the son and the holy spirit which safeguards the unity of the holy trinity

the way to christ 14 jakob b\u00f6hme was very influential to a number of christian mystics and religious leaders including george rapp william law and the harmony society 15 the 1993 re imagining

later in the midst of tara s threat scarlett marries frank kennedy suellen s beau for financial security for tara and providing for the family they have ella lorena kennedy together kennedy dies in a

they have eugenia victoria a k a bonnie blue butler however she dies after a tragic riding accident unable to reconcile rhett leaves scarlett although scarlett ends the novel vowing to try to win him back character summary edit when the novel opens scarlett o hara is sixteen she is vain self centered and very spoiled by her wealthy parents she can also be insecure but is very intelligent despite the old south s pretense of ignorance and helplessness she is somewhat unusual among southern women whom society preferred to act as dainty creatures who needed protection from their men scarlett is aware that she is only acting empty headed and resents the necessity of it unlike most of her southern belle peers including melanie hamilton and india wilkes outwardly scarlett is the picture of southern charm and womanly virtues and a popular belle among the country males the one man she truly desires however is her neighbor ashley wilkes the one man she cannot have the wilkes family has a tradition of intermarrying with their cousins and ashley is betrothed to his cousin melanie hamilton of atlanta scarlett s motivation in the early part of the novel centers on her desire to win ashley s heart when he refuses her advances which no southern lady would be so forward as to make she takes refuge in childish rage and she spitefully accepts the proposal of charles hamilton melanie s brother in a misguided effort to get back at ashley and melanie scarlett with third husband rhett butler rhett butler a wealthy older bachelor and a societal pariah overhears scarlett express her love to ashley during a barbecue at twelve oaks the wilkes estate rhett admires scarlett s willfulness and her departure from accepted propriety as well as her beauty he pursues scarlett but is aware of her impetuousness childish spite and her fixation on ashley he assists scarlett in defiance of proper victorian mourning customs when her husband charles hamilton dies in a training camp rhett encourages her spirited behavior in atlanta society scarlett privately frustrated from the strict rules of polite society finds friendship with rhett liberating the civil war sweeps away the lifestyle in which scarlett was raised and southern society falls into ruin scarlett left destitute after sherman s army marches through georgia becomes the sole source of strength for her family her character begins to harden as her relatives the family slaves and the wilkes family look to her for protection from homelessness and starvation scarlett becomes money conscious and more materialistic in her motivation to ensure her family survives and tara stays in her possession while other georgian farmers lose their homes this extends to first offering herself as a mistress to rhett although after rhett s rejection scarlett resorts to marrying her younger sister s beau frank kennedy investing in and starting a business herself engaging in controversial business practices and even exploiting convict labor in order to make her lumber business profit her conduct results in the accidental death of frank and shortly after she marries rhett butler for fun and because he is very wealthy they have a little girl named bonnie but she dies from a horseback riding accident that leaves rhett and scarlett s relationship unstable scarlett is too fixated on ashley wilkes to realize her pursuit of him is misdirected until the climax of the novel with the death of melanie wilkes she realizes her pursuit of ashley was a childish romance and she has loved rhett butler for some time she pursues rhett from the wilkes home to their home only to discover he has given up hope of ever receiving her love and is about to leave her after telling him she loves him he refuses to stay with her which leads to the famous line in the movie frankly my dear i don t give a damn wracked with grief but determined to win him back scarlett returns to tara to regain her strength and create a plan to reunite with rhett common character analysis edit scarlett s character portrayed in both the novel and 1939 film is at face value unscrupulous and selfish but her character development ultimately portrays multiple stigmas throughout that support mitchell s theme in a rare interview mitchell admitted the theme of the novel was survival specifically shown is exploring human behavior in the face of the catastrophe of the civil war 7 decades later literary critics and authors agree that scarlett s revolution from a spoiled wealthy girl typical of her socioeconomic status to becoming an independent woman in an unforgiving society and unstable economy is a testament to the development of mitchell s character lisa bertagnoli author of scarlett rules compared scarlett to a chameleon by morphing herself from a pampered girl to a no nonsense businesswoman responsible for feeding not only herself but her extended family as well 8 scarlett stands out in the novel because she alone among her female peers is the only one who survives and thrives despite sherman s march through atlanta despite being widowed twice despite being a woman in a patriarchal society 9 she was told no to almost every action she did to survive by both societal standards and her female and male peers around her such as marrying frank kennedy for money or even running a successful business and in return she told them watch me in the process scarlett struggled with her status as a woman because of standards of the southern lady invoked and shown at the beginning of the novel and displayed throughout scarlett s peers embodied in melanie wilkes however this is clearly challenged by scarlett because of the dire conditions she is meant to face and endure therefore those standards of the southern lady are discarded because the standards do not meet her physical needs nor are useful to her physical survival the essence of the public responsibility of being a lady is flagrantly disregarded because of her commitment to survival fox genovese p 400 9 thus she is ostracized from her peers scarlett does not uphold the same code of standard as she did in the beginning of the novel because her motivations changed from societal and class standings to economic status and physical survival inspiration for the character edit margaret mitchell margaret mitchell used to say that her gone with the wind characters were not based on real people although modern researchers have found similarities to some of the people in mitchell s own life scarlett s upbringing resembled that of mitchell s maternal grandmother annie fitzgerald stephens 1844 1934 who was raised predominantly irish catholic on a plantation near jonesboro in fayette not unlike the o hara family 7 mitchell was engaged three times although only married twice her first engagement was to clifford henry a bayonet instructor at camp gordon in world war i he was killed overseas in october 1918 while fighting in france 7 similar to o hara and her first husband charles hamilton mitchell s mother maybelle stephens mitchell contracted influenza and died shortly before mitchell could reach home similar to ellen o hara dying before scarlett fled atlanta rhett butler is thought to be based on mitchell s first husband red upshaw because upshaw left atlanta for the midwest and never returned 7 her second marriage was to john robert marsh and they were married until her death in 1949 7 in the 1939 film edit casting edit while the studio and the public agreed that the part of rhett butler should go to clark gable except for clark gable himself casting for the role of scarlett was harder the search for an actress to play scarlett in the film version of the novel famously drew the biggest names in the history of cinema such as bette davis who had been cast as a southern belle in jezebel in 1938 and katharine hepburn who went so far as demanding an appointment with producer david o selznick and saying i am scarlett o hara the role is practically written for me selznick replied rather bluntly i can t imagine rhett butler chasing you for twelve years 10 jean arthur and lucille ball were also considered as well as relatively unknown actress doris davenport susan hayward was discovered when she tested for the part and the career of lana turner developed quickly after her screen test tallulah bankhead and joan bennett were widely considered to be the most likely choices until they were supplanted by paulette goddard vivien leigh as scarlett o hara the young english actress vivien leigh virtually unknown in america saw that several english actors including ronald colman and leslie howard were in consideration for the male leads in gone with the wind her agent happened to be the london representative of the myron selznick talent agency headed by david selznick s brother myron leigh asked myron to put her name into consideration as scarlett on the eve of the american release of her picture fire over england in february 1938 david selznick watched both fire over england and her most recent picture a yank at oxford that month and thought she was excellent but in no way a possible scarlett for she was too british but myron selznick arranged for david to first meet leigh on the night in december 1938 when the burning of the atlanta depot was being filmed on the forty acres backlot that selznick international and rko shared leigh and her then lover laurence olivier later to be her husband were visiting as guests of myron selznick who was also olivier s agent while leigh was in hollywood hoping for a part in olivier s current movie wuthering heights in a letter to his wife two days later david selznick admitted that leigh was the scarlett dark horse and after a series of screen tests her casting was announced on january 13 1939 just before the shooting of the film selznick informed ed sullivan scarlett o hara s parents were french and irish identically miss leigh s parents are french and irish 11 in any case leigh was cast despite public protest that the role was too american for an english actress but leigh was able to pull off the role so well that she eventually won an academy award for her performance as scarlett o hara other actresses considered edit the search for scarlett began shortly after the announcement of the film adaption and lasted for over two years 12 between late 1937 and mid 1938 approximately 128 actresses were nominated for the role of scarlett through letters of suggestion sent to selznick international pictures from the public 13 the following actresses were among those considered or auditioned for the role which required playing scarlett from 16 years of age until she was 28 actress age in 1939 the year of gone with the wind s release when leigh was 26 out of these considered only 31 actresses made screen tests including with the date of their initial screen test and their age at the time 14 15 turner was eliminated after her screen test with cukor feeling she was too young to have the depth the role required 14 by december 1938 cukor and selznick had narrowed the decision down to goddard and leigh on december 21 both actresses were given technicolor screen tests the only ones to receive the tests leigh was chosen following the tests a controversial choice among the public since she was not an american 15 in other adaptations edit comparisons to other characters edit troy patterson of entertainment weekly argued that ally mcbeal the main character of the television series with the same name has similarities to o hara and that scarlett and ally are fairy tale princesses who bear about as much resemblance to real women as barbie and skipper 17 patterson wrote that ally is similar because she is also a child from a ruling class family pines hopelessly after an unavailable dreamboat and has a sassy black roommate in place of a mammy to comfort her 17 other characters often compared to scarlett include many female protagonists from other romantic epics most notably lara antipova from the 1965 film doctor zhivago and rose dewitt bukater from titanic 1997 as well as strong willed women in history such as cleopatra marie antoinette and eva peron vivien leigh s subsequent oscar winning portrayal of southern belle blanche dubois on stage and in the 1951 film adaptation of a streetcar named desire has drawn comparison to her performance as scarlett 18 the role was coincidentally originally written for tallulah bankhead who had also auditioned for the scarlett o hara role the character of blanche is often viewed as a middle aged antithesis to the strong willed youthful scarlett 18 blanche struggles with mental illness violent abuse from stanley and severe anxiety ultimately unlike scarlett who pulls herself together to overcome her troubles blanche descends into madness and gets committed to a mental institution in popular culture edit in the 1977 song belle

uses see sonnet disambiguation a sonnet is a fixed poetic form with a structure traditionally consisting of fourteen lines adhering to a set rhyming scheme 1 the term derives from the italian word sonetto lit little song from the latin word sonus lit sound originating in 13th century sicily the sonnet was in time taken up in many european language areas mainly to express romantic love at first although eventually any subject was considered acceptable many formal variations were also introduced including abandonment of the quatorzain limit and even of rhyme altogether in modern times romance languages edit sicilian edit giacomo da lentini is credited with the sonnet s invention at the court of frederick ii in the sicilian city of palermo the sicilian school of poets who surrounded lentini then spread the form to the mainland those earliest sonnets no longer survive in the original sicilian language however but only after being translated into tuscan dialect the form consisted of a pair of quatrains followed by a pair of tercets with the symmetrical rhyme scheme a b a b a b a b c d c d c d displaystyle mathrm abababab cdcdcd where the sense is carried forward in a new direction after the midway break peter dronke has commented that there was something intrinsic to its flexible form that contributed to the sonnet s survival far beyond its region of origin 2 william baer suggests that the first eight lines of the earliest sicilian sonnets are identical to the eight line sicilian folksong stanza known as the strambotto to this da lentini or whoever else invented the form added two tercets to the strambotto in order to create the new 14 line sonnet form 3 in contrast hassanally ladha 4 has argued that the sicilian sonnet s structure and content drew upon arabic poetry and cannot be explained as the invention of the sicilian school of poets ladha notes that in its sicilian beginnings the sonnet evinces literary and epistemological contact with the qasida 5 and emphasizes that the sonnet did not emerge simultaneously with its supposedly defining 14 line structure tellingly attempts to close off the sonnet from its arabic predecessors depend upon a definition of the new lyric to which giacomo s poetry does not conform surviving in thirteenth century recensions his poems appear not in fourteen but rather six lines including four rows each with two hemistiches and two tercets each in a line extending over two rows 6 in ladha s view the sonnet emerges as the continuation of a broader tradition of love poetry throughout the mediterranean world and relates to such other forms as the sicilian strambotto the proven\u00e7al canso the andalusi arabic muwashshah and zajal as well as the qasida 7 italian edit the first five sonnets of petrarch s il canzoniere guittone d arezzo rediscovered the sonnet form and brought it to tuscany where he adapted it to tuscan dialect when he founded the siculo tuscan or guittonian school of poetry 1235 1294 he wrote almost 250 sonnets 8 among the host of other italian poets that followed the sonnets of dante alighieri and guido cavalcanti stand out but later the most famous and widely influential was petrarch the structure of a typical italian sonnet as it developed included two parts that together formed a compact form of argument first the octave forms the proposition which describes a problem or question followed by a sestet two tercets that proposes a resolution typically the ninth line initiates what is called the turn or volta which signals the move from proposition to resolution even in sonnets that do not strictly follow the problem resolution structure the ninth line still often marks a turn by signaling a change in the tone mood or stance of the poem later the a b b a a b b a displaystyle mathrm abba abba pattern became the standard for italian sonnets for the sestet there were two different possibilities c d e c d e displaystyle mathrm cdecde and c d c c d c displaystyle mathrm cdc cdc in time other variants on this rhyming scheme were introduced such as c d c d c d displaystyle mathrm cdc dcd or c d e d c e displaystyle mathrm cde dce petrarch typically used an a b b a a b b a displaystyle mathrm abba abba pattern for the octave followed by either c d e c d e displaystyle mathrm cde cde or c d c c d c displaystyle mathrm cdc cdc rhymes in the sestet at the turn of the 14th century there arrive early examples of the sonnet sequence unified about a single theme this is represented by folgore da san gimignano s series on the months of the year 9 followed by his sequence on the days of the week 10 at a slightly earlier date dante had published his la vita nuova a narrative commentary in which appear sonnets and other lyrical forms centred on the poet s love for beatrice 11 most of the sonnets there are petrarchan here used as a purely stylistic term since dante predated petrarch chapter vii gives the sonnet o voi che per la via with two sestets a a b a a b a a b a a b displaystyle mathrm aabaab aabaab and two quatrains c d d c c d d c displaystyle mathrm cddc cddc and ch viii morte villana with two sestets a a b b b a a a b b b a displaystyle mathrm aabbba aabbba and two quatrains c d d c c d d c displaystyle mathrm cddc cddc petrarch followed in his footsteps later in the next century with the 366 sonnets of the canzionere which chronicle his life long love for laura 12 widespread as sonnet writing became in italian society among practitioners were to be found some better known for other things the painters giotto and michelangelo for example and the astronomer galileo the academician giovanni mario crescimbeni lists 661 poets just in the 16th century 13 so common were they that eventually in the words of a literary historian no event was so trivial none so commonplace a tradesman could not open a larger shop a government clerk could not obtain a few additional scudi of salary but all his friends and acquaintance must celebrate the event and clothe their congratulations in a copy of verses which almost invariably assumed this shape 14 occitan edit the sole confirmed surviving sonnet in the occitan language is by paolo lanfranchi da pistoia and confidently dated to 1284 15 this employs the rhyme scheme a b a b a b a b c d c d c d displaystyle mathrm abab abab cdcdcd and has a political theme as do some others of dubious authenticity or merit ascribed to william of almarichi and dante de maiano catalan edit one of the earliest sonnets in catalan was written by pere torroella 1436 1486 16 in the 16th century the most prolific and subtle catalan writer of sonnets was pere seraf\u00ed 17 author of over 60 published between 1560 and 1565 spanish edit the poet \u00ed\u00f1igo l\u00f3pez de mendoza 1st marquis of santillana is credited as among the foremost to attempt sonnets written in the italian manner sonetos fechos al it\u00e1lico modo towards the middle of the 15th century since the castilian language and prosody were in a transitional state at the time the experiment was unsuccessful 18 it was therefore not until after 1526 that the form was reintroduced by juan bosc\u00e1n according to his account he met andrea navagero the venetian ambassador to the spanish court in that year while the latter was accompanying king carlos v on a visit to the alhambra in the course of their literary discussion navagero then suggested that the poet might attempt the sonnet and other italian forms in his own language 19 bosc\u00e1n not only took up the venetian s advice but did so in association with the more talented garcilaso de la vega a friend to whom some of his sonnets are addressed and whose early death is mourned in another the poems of both followed the petrarchan model employed the hitherto unfamiliar hendecasyllable and when writing of love were based on the neoplatonic ideal championed in the book of the courtier il cortegiano that bosc\u00e1n had also translated their reputation was consolidated by the later 1580 edition of fernando de herrera who was himself accounted the first major spanish sonneteer after garcilaso 20 during the baroque period that followed two notable writers of sonnets headed rival stylistic schools the culteranismo of luis de g\u00f3ngora later known as gongorismo after him was distinguished by an artificial style and the use of elaborate vocabulary complex syntactical order and involved metaphors the verbal usage of his opponent francisco de quevedo was equally self conscious deploying wordplay and metaphysical conceits after which the style was known as conceptismo another key figure at this period was lope de vega who was responsible for writing some 3 000 sonnets a large proportion of them incorporated into his dramas one of the best known and most imitated was un soneto me manda hacer violante 21 violante orders me to write a sonnet which occupies a pivotal position in literary history at its first appearance in his 1617 comedy la ni\u00f1a de plata act 3 the character there pretends to be a novice whose text is a running commentary on the poem s creation although the poet himself is portrayed as composing it as a light hearted impromptu in the biographical film lope 2010 there had in fact been precedents in spanish some fifty years before diego hurtado de mendoza had written the pretended impromptu ped\u00eds reina un soneto and even earlier in italian there had been the similarly themed qualunque vuol saper fare un sonetto whoever to make a sonnet aspires by the florentine poet pieraccio tedaldi b ca 1285 1290 d ca 1350 22 later imitations in other languages include one in italian by giambattista marino and another in french by fran\u00e7ois s\u00e9raphin r\u00e9gnier desmarais as well as an adaptation of the idea applied to the rondeau by vincent voiture 23 the poem s fascination for u s writers is evidenced by no less than five translations in the second half of the 20th century alone 24 the sonnet form crossed the atlantic quite early in the spanish colonial enterprise when francisco de terrazas the son of a 16th century conquistador was among its mexican pioneers later came two sonnet writers in holy orders bishop miguel de guevara 1585 1646 and especially sister juana in\u00e9s de la cruz but though sonnets continued to be written in both the old world and the new innovation was mainly limited to the americas where the sonnet was used to express a different and post colonial reality in the 19th century for example there were two poets who wrote memorable sonnets dedicated to mexican landscapes joaqu\u00edn acadio pagaza y ord\u00f3\u00f1ez in the torrid zone to the south and manuel jos\u00e9 oth\u00f3n in the desolate north 25 in south america too the sonnet was used to invoke landscape particularly in the major collections of the uruguayan julio herrera y reissig such as los parques abandonados deserted parks 1902 08 26 and los \u00e9xtasis de la monta\u00f1a mountain ecstasies 1904 07 27 whose recognisably authentic pastoral scenes went on to serve as example for c\u00e9sar vallejo in his evocations of andean peru 28 soon afterwards the sonnet form was deconstructed as part of the modernist questioning of the past thus in the argentine poet alfonsina storni s mascarilla y tr\u00e9bol mask and clover 1938 a section of unrhymed poems using many of the traditional versification structures of the form are presented under the title antisonnets 29 portuguese edit dom pedro a son of king john i has been credited with translations of sonnets by petrarch into portuguese 30 but the form did not come into its own until the start of the 16th century it was then that s\u00e1 de miranda introduced the sonnet and other italian forms after returning from a five year stay in italy 31 however the greatest sonneteer of this period was the slightly younger lu\u00eds de cam\u00f5es 32 33 though in his work the influence of the spanish pioneers of the form has also been discerned 34 among later writers the comic sonnets of thomas de noronha were once appreciated and the love sonnets of barbosa bacellar c 1610 1663 also known for his learned glosses on the sonnets of cam\u00f5es 35 the introduction later of a purified sonnet style to brazilian literature was due to cl\u00e1udio manuel da costa who also composed petrarchan sonnets in italian during his stay in europe 36 however it was in the wake of french parnassianism that there developed a similar movement in brazil which included the notable sonneteers alberto de oliveira raimundo correia and especially olavo bilac 37 others writing sonnets in that style included the now overlooked francisca j\u00falia da silva munster 1871 1920 38 and the symbolist afro brazilian poet cruz e sousa french edit in french prosody sonnets are traditionally composed in the french alexandrine which consists of lines of twelve syllables with a central caesura imitations of petrarch were first introduced by cl\u00e9ment marot and mellin de saint gelais also took up the form near the start of the 16th century 39 they were later followed by pierre de ronsard joachim du bellay and jean antoine de ba\u00eff around whom formed a group of radical young noble poets of the court generally known today as la pl\u00e9iade they employed amongst other forms of poetry the petrarchan sonnet cycle developed around an amorous encounter or an idealized woman the character of the group s literary program was given in du bellay s manifesto the defense and illustration of the french language 1549 which maintained that french like the tuscan of petrarch and dante was a worthy language for literary expression and which promulgated a program of linguistic and literary production and purification 40 in the aftermath of the wars of religion french catholic jurist and poet jean de la cepp\u00e8de published the theorems a sequence of 515 sonnets with non traditional rhyme schemes about the passion and resurrection of jesus christ drawing upon the gospels greek and roman mythology and the fathers of the church la cepp\u00e8de s poetry was praised by saint francis de sales for transforming the pagan muses into christian ones la cepp\u00e8de s sonnets often attack the calvinist doctrine of a judgmental and unforgiving god by focusing on christ s passionate love for the human race afterwards the work was long forgotten until the 20th century witnessed a revival of interest in the poet and his sonnets are now regarded as classic works of french poetry 41 by the late 17th century the sonnet had fallen out of fashion but was revived by the romantics in the 19th century charles augustin sainte beuve then published his imitation of william wordsworth s scorn not the sonnet where in addition to the poets enumerated in the english original shakespeare petrarch tasso camoens dante spenser milton sainte beuve announces his own intention to revive the form and adds the names of du bellay and ronsard in the final tercet 42 the form was little used however until the parnassians brought it back into favour and following them the symbolist poets overseas in canada the teenaged \u00e9mile nelligan is particularly noted among the french language poets who wrote sonnets in that style 43 during the latter half of the 19th century there were many deviations from the traditional sonnet form charles baudelaire was responsible for significant variations in rhyme scheme and line length in the poems included in les fleurs du mal 44 among the variations made by others th\u00e9odore de banville s sur une dame blonde limited itself to a four syllable line 45 while in \u00e0 une jeune morte jules de ress\u00e9guier 1788 1862 composed a sonnet monosyllabically lined 46 germanic languages edit english edit tudor and stuart period edit sir thomas wyatt and henry howard earl of surrey have been described as the first english petrarchans from their pioneering the sonnet form in english in addition some 25 of wyatt s poems are dependent on petrarch either as translations or imitations while of surrey s five three of them are translations and two imitations 47 in one instance both poets translated the same poem rime 140 48 from these examples as elsewhere in their prosodic practice a difference between their style can be observed wyatt s verse metre though in general decasyllabic is irregular and proceeds by way of significantly stressed phrasal units 49 but in addition wyatt s sonnets are generally closer in construction to those of petrarch prosodically surrey is more adept at composing in iambic pentameter and his sonnets are written in what has come to be known anachronistically as shakespearean measure 50 this version of the sonnet form characterised by three alternately rhymed quatrains terminating in a final couple a b a b c d c d e f e f g g displaystyle mathrm abab cdcd efef gg became the favourite during elizabethan times when it was widely used it was particularly so in whole series of amatory sequences beginning with sir philip sidney s astrophel and stella 1591 and continuing over a period of two decades about four thousand sonnets were composed during this time 51 however with such a volume much there that was conventional and repetitious came to be viewed with a sceptical eye sir john davies mocked these in a series of nine gulling sonnets 52 and william shakespeare was also to dismiss some of them in his sonnet 130 my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun the title page of the first edition of shakespeare s sonnets shakespeare s sequence of 154 sonnets departs from the norm in addressing more than one person in its course male as well as female in addition other sonnets by him were incorporated into some of his plays another exception at this time was the form used in edmund spenser s amoretti which has the interlaced rhyme scheme a b a b b c b c c d c d e e displaystyle mathrm abab bcbc cdcd ee during the 1590s there began a change of focus from amatory to religious subject matter this was announced in the opening line of the divine centurie of spirituall sonnets of barnabe barnes 1595 no more lewde laies of lighter loues i sing 53 other sequences in this line include henry lok s series of sonnets added to his translation of ecclesiastes 1597 54 henry constable s spirituall sonnettes to the honour of god and hys sayntes c 1600 55 and the sonnets collected with other poems in nicholas breton s the soule s harmony 1602 56 john donne s series of holy sonnets followed soon after and as in some of his elizabethan predecessors and french religious sonnet sequences such as the sonnets spirituels of jacques de billy 1577 and jean de la cepp\u00e8de s th\u00e9or\u00e8mes spirituels 1613 21 are characterised by their use of baroque conceits 57 58 john milton s sonnets demonstrate another stylistic transition two youthful examples written in english and five in italian are petrarchan in spirit but the seventeen sonnets of his maturity address personal and political themes it has been observed of their intimate tone and the way the sense overrides the volta within the poem in some cases that milton is here adapting the sonnet form to that of the horatian ode 59 he also seems to have been the first to introduce an italian variation of the form the caudate sonnet into english in his prolongation of on the new forcers of conscience under the long parliament 60 18th 19th centuries edit the fashion for the sonnet went out with the restoration and hardly any were written between 1670 and the second half of the 18th century amongst the first to revive the form was thomas warton who took milton for his model around him at oxford were grouped those associated with him in this revival including john codrington bampfylde thomas russell thomas warwick and henry headley some of whom published small collections of sonnets alone 61 many women too now took up the sonnet form in particular charlotte smith whose lachrymose elegiac sonnets 1784 onwards are credited with helping create the school of sensibility characteristic of the time 62 william lisle bowles was also a close follower but the success of both stirred up resistance in the poetic politics of the time william beckford parodied smith s melancholy manner and archaic diction in an elegiac sonnet to a mopstick 63 in the preface to his 1796 collection poems on various subjects samuel taylor coleridge commented of his series of effusions that i was fearful that the title sonnet might have reminded my reader of the poems of the rev w l bowles a comparison with whom would have sunk me below that mediocrity on the surface of which i am at present enabled to float 64 there were formal objections too where most of the early revivalists had used milton s sonnets as the model for theirs smith and bowles had preferred the shakespearean form this led to mary robinson s fighting preface to her sequence sappho and phaon in which she asserted the legitimacy of the petrarchan form as used by milton over the non descript ephemera from the heated brains of self important poetasters that pass as sonnets in the literary reviews of her day 65 at the start of the 19th century capel lofft expressed his sense of the importance of the sonnet s history to the new generation of english poets in the long preface to his idiosyncratic laura or an anthology of sonnets on the petrarchan model and elegiac quatorzains london 1814 the thesis is developed that beyond the sonnet s sicilian origin lies the system of musical notation developed by the mediaeval guido of arezzo and before that the musical arrangement of the greek ode 66 the young milton he noted had learned the mature italian style while travelling in italy and conversing on equal terms with its writers as well as writing five sonnets in italian as well 67 in form his are modelled on petrarch s and dealing as they do with both personal and contemporary issues are reminiscent in their organisation of the horatian ode 68 impressed too by milton s sonnets wordsworth described the form as having an energetic and varied flow of sound crowding into narrow room more of the combined effect of rhyme and blank verse than can be done by any other kind of verse i know of 69 in that its compression could be adapted to a great variety of themes he eventually wrote some 523 sonnets which were to exert a powerful stylistic influence throughout the first half of the 19th century 70 part of his appeal to others was the way in which he used the sonnet as a focus for new subject matter frequently in sequences from his series on the river duddon 71 sprang reflections on any number of regional natural features his travel tour effusions though not always confined to sonnet form 72 found many imitators what eventually became three series of ecclesiastical sonnets 73 started a vogue for sonnets on religious and devotional themes 74 milton s predilection for political themes continuing through wordsworth s sonnets dedicated to liberty and order now became an example for contemporaries too barely had the process begun however before a sceptical alarmist in the new monthly magazine for 1821 was diagnosing sonnettomania as a new sickness akin to the bite of a rabid animal 75 another arm of the propaganda on behalf of the sonnet in romantic times was the reflexive strategy of recommending it in sonnet form as a demonstration of its possibility of variation in wordsworth s nuns fret not at their narrow room 1807 76 the volta comes after the seventh line dividing the poem into two equal parts keats makes use of frequent enjambment in if by dull rhymes our english must be chained 1816 77 and divides its sense units into four tercets and a couplet what keats is recommending there is the more intricate rhyming system a b c c a b c d e d e displaystyle mathrm a b c c a b c d e d e that he demonstrates in its course as a means of giving the form greater breathing room wordsworth later accomplishes this in scorn not the sonnet 1827 78 which is without midway division and where enjambment is so managed that the sense overrides from line to line in an ode like movement with the similar aim of freeing the form from its fetters matthew arnold turns his austerity of poetry 1867 79 into a narrative carried forward over an enjambed eighth line to a conclusion that is limited to the final three lines d g rossetti s illuminated description of the sonnet 1880 by the time the second half of the 19th century was reached sonnets become chiefly interesting for their publication in long sequences it was during this period that attempts to renew the form were continually being made elizabeth barrett browning s autobiographical sonnets from the portuguese 1845 50 80 for example is described as the first depiction of a successful courtship since elizabethan times 81 it comprises 44 sonnets of dramatised first person narrative the enjambed lines in which frequently avoid resting at the volta through this means the work is distinguished by the flexibility and control with which the verse bends to the argument and to the rhythms of thought and speech 82 that sequence was followed in 1862 by george meredith s modern love 83 based in part on the breakdown of his first marriage it employs a 16 line form described as and working like a sonnet linking together the work s fifty narrative episodes essentially the stanza is made up of four quatrains of enclosed rhyme rhythmically driven forward over these divisions so as to allow a greater syntactical complexity more readily associated with the realist novel than with lyric poetry 84 as other work by both the writers above demonstrates they were capable of more straightforward fictions in adapting the sonnet to the narrative mode the main interest for them is in overcoming the technical challenge that they set themselves and proving the new possibilities of the form in which they are working where the first quatrain in sonnets from the portuguese began with a reminiscence of lines from a pastoral of theocritus edward cracroft lefroy 1855 1891 responded by reaching beyond the narrative mode towards the dramatic in the thirty adaptations from the greek of his echoes from theocritus 1885 reprint 1922 85 beyond this though the idea of arranging such material in a sequence was original to lefroy thomas warwick had anticipated the approach a century before in his sonnet from bacchylides equally based on a fragment of an ancient greek author on the other hand eugene lee hamilton s exploration of the sonnet s dramatic possibilities was through creating historical monologues in his hundred imaginary sonnets 1888 86 based on episodes chosen from the seven centuries between 1120 1820 neither sequence was anywhere the equal of those of barrett browning or meredith 87 but they illustrate a contemporary urge to make new a form that was fast running out of steam 20th century edit as part of his attempted renewal of poetic prosody gerard manley hopkins had applied his experimental sprung rhythm to the composition of the sonnet amplifying the number of unstressed syllables within a five or occasionally six stressed line as in the rhetorical the windhover for example he also introduced variations in the proportions of the sonnet from the 101 2 lines of the curtal sonnet pied beauty to the amplified 24 line caudate sonnet that nature is a heraclitean fire though they were written in the later victorian era the poems remained virtually unknown until they were published in 1918 88 the undergraduate w h auden is sometimes credited with dispensing with rhyme altogether in the secret agent 89 he went on to write many conventional sonnets later including two long sequences during the time of international crisis in time of war 1939 and the quest 1940 in which the use of geography and landscape to symbolise spiritual and mental states owes something to the earlier example of rilke 90 sequences by some other poets have been more experimental and looser in form of which a radical example was altarwise by owl light 1935 ten irregular and barely rhyming quatorzains by dylan thomas in his most opaque manner 91 in 1978 two later innovatory sequences were published at a period when it was considered that the sonnet seems to want to lie fallow exhausted in the words of one commentator 92 peter dale s book length one another contains a dialogue of some sixty sonnets in which the variety of rhyming methods are as diverse as the emotions expressed between the speakers there 93 at the same time geoffrey hill s an apology for the revival of christian architecture in england appeared in tenebrae 1978 where the challenging thirteen poems of the sequence employ half rhyme and generally ignore the volta 94 seamus heaney also wrote two sequences during this period the personal glanmore sonnets in field work 1975 95 and the more freely constructed elegiac sonnets of clearances in the haw lantern 1987 96 in north america edit usa edit the earliest american sonnet is david humphreys s 97 1776 sonnet addressed to my friends at yale college on my leaving them to join the army 98 the sonnet form was used widely thereafter including by william lloyd garrison and william cullen bryant 99 later henry wadsworth longfellow and others followed suit 100 his were characterised by a purple richness of diction and by their use of material images to illustrate niceties of thought and emotion 101 he also translated several sonnets including seven by michelangelo 102 later on among emma lazarus many sonnets perhaps the best known is the new colossus of 1883 103 which celebrates the statue of liberty and its role in welcoming immigrants to the new world in the 19th century sonnets written by american poets began to be anthologised as such they were included in a separate section in leigh hunt and s adams the book of the sonnet london and boston 1867 which included an essay by adams on american sonnets and sonneteers and a section devoted only to sonnets by american women 104 later came william sharp s anthology of american sonnets 1889 105 and charles h crandall s representative sonnets by american poets with an essay on the sonnet its nature and history houghton mifflin co 1890 the essay also surveyed the whole history of the sonnet including english examples and european examples in translation in order to contextualise the american achievement 106 recent scholarship has recovered many african american sonnets that were not anthologised in standard american poetry volumes important nineteenth and early twentieth century writers have included paul laurence dunbar countee cullen sterling a brown and jamaican born claude mckay 107 some of their sonnets were personal responses to experience of displacement and racial prejudice cullen s at the wailing wall in jerusalem 1927 for example suggests a parallel between the history of his race and that of the jewish diaspora 108 and mckay s sonnets of 1921 respond defiantly to the deadly red summer riots two years before 109 there were also several african american women poets who won prizes for volumes that included sonnets including margaret walker yale poetry series gwendolyn brooks pulitzer prize rita dove pulitzer prize and natasha trethewey pulitzer prize 99 110 but there were other writers like langston hughes and amiri baraka for example who despite publishing some themselves questioned the appropriateness of sonnets for black poets in the opinion of hughes the emergence of truly individual writing based on folk genres and experience was hindered by the imposition of genteel white verse forms irrelevant to them 111 one aspect of the american sonnet during the 20th century was the publication of sequences which had to wait decades for critical recognition one instance is this man s army a war in fifty odd sonnets 1928 by john allan wyeth 112 a series of irregular sonnets that recorded impressions of his military service with the american expeditionary force during the first world war it was scarcely noticed when it first appeared yet on its republication in 2008 dana gioia asserted in his introduction that wyeth is the only american poet of the great war who can stand comparison to british war poets 113 a claim later corroborated by jon stallworthy in his review of the work 114 shortly after the publication of wyeth s h p lovecraft wrote his very different sonnet sequence sections of which first appeared in genre magazines it was not until 1943 that it saw complete publication as fungi from yuggoth these 36 poems were written in a hybrid form based on the petrarchan sonnet that invariably ends with a rhyming couplet reminiscent of the shakespearean sonnet 115 most of these poems are discontinuous though unified by theme being vignettes descriptive of the kinds of dreamed and otherworldly scenarios found in lovecraft s fiction 116 their unmannered style was once compared to edward arlington robinson s 117 but since then a case has been made for the work as minor poetry of contemporary importance in its own right 118 in the case of john berryman he initially wrote a series of some hundred modernistic love sonnets during the 1940s these however remained uncollected until 1967 when they appeared as berryman s sonnets fleshed out with a few additions to give them the form of a sequence in her 2014 survey of the book for poetry april bernard suggests that he was there making of berryman a similar semi fictional character to the henry in the dream songs 1964 she also identifies an ancient ancestry for the disordered syntax of the work through the english poets thomas wyatt and gerard manley hopkins 119 but at this time too began to appear sequences of quatorzains with only a tenuous relationship to the sonnet form ted berrigan s the sonnets 1964 discard metre and rhyme but retain the dynamics of a 14 line structure with a change of direction at the volta berrigan claimed to have been inspired by shakespeare s sonnets because they were quick musical witty and short 120 others have described berrigan s work as a postmodern collage using repetition rearrangement and the use of found phrases and text that functions as a radical deconstruction of the sonnet 121 from 1969 robert lowell too began publishing a less radical deconstruction of the form in his series of five collections of blank verse sonnets including his pulitzer prize volume the dolphin 1973 these he described as having the eloquence at best of iambic pentameter and often the structure and climaxes of sonnets 122 the contemporary reaction against the strict form is described in the introduction to william baer s anthology sonnets 150 contemporary sonnets 2005 but for all that a number of writers were declaring then that the sonnet was dead others including richard wilbur howard nemerov and anthony hecht continued to write sonnets and eventually became associated with the magazines the formalist and then measure these journals champions of the new formalism between the years 1994 and 2017 sponsored the annual howard nemerov sonnet award canada edit in canada during the last decades of the 19th century the confederation poets and especially archibald lampman were known for their sonnets which were mainly on pastoral themes 123 canadian poet seymour mayne has published a few collections of word sonnets and is one of the chief innovators of a form using a single word per line to capture its honed perception 124 in german edit paulus melissus was the first to introduce the sonnet into german poetry 125 but the man who did most to raise the sonnet to german consciousness was martin opitz who in two works buch von der deutschen poeterey 1624 and acht b\u00fccher deutscher poematum 1625 established the sonnet as a separate genre and its rules of composition it was to be written in iambic alexandrines with alternating masculine and feminine enclosed rhymes in the octave and a more flexible sestet with three rhymes reinforcing them were translated examples from petrarch ronsard and daniel heinsius 126 thereafter in the 18th century johann wolfgang von goethe wrote several love sonnets using a rhyme scheme derived from italian poetry after his death goethe s followers created the freer german sonnet which is rhymed a b b a b c c b c d d c d d displaystyle mathrm abba bccb cdd cdd the sonnet tradition was then continued by august wilhelm von schlegel paul von heyse and others reaching fruition in rainer maria rilke s sonnets to orpheus which has been described as one of the great modern poems not to mention a monumental addition to the literature of the sonnet sequence 127 a cycle of 55 sonnets it was written in two parts in 1922 while rilke was in the midst of completing his duino elegies the full title in german is die sonette an orpheus geschrieben als ein grab mal f\u00fcr wera ouckama knoop translated as sonnets to orpheus written as a monument for wera ouckama knoop commemorating the recent death of a young dancer from leukaemia the grab mal literally grave marker of the title brings to mind the series of tombeaux written by st\u00e9phane mallarm\u00e9 translated among others by rilke in 1919 also coinciding with the sonnets of michelangelo which rilke had been translating in 1921 rilke s own sonnets are fluidly structured as a transposition of the dead girl s dancing and encompass themes of life and death and art s relation to them as well as having varied rhyme schemes line lengths also vary and are irregularly metred even within the same sonnet at times 128 responses to turbulent times form a distinct category among german sonnets they include friedrich r\u00fcckert s 72 sonnets in armour geharnischte sonneten 1814 stirring up resistance to napoleonic domination and sonnets by emanuel geibel written during the german revolutions of 1848 1849 and the first schleswig war 129 in the wake of the first world war anton schnack described by one anthologist as the only german language poet whose work can be compared with that of wilfred owen published the sonnet sequence tier rang gewaltig mit tier beast strove mightily with beast 1920 the 60 poems there have the typical german sonnet form but are written in the long lined free rhythms developed by ernst stadler 130 patrick bridgwater writing in 1985 called the work without question the best single collection produced by a german war poet in 1914 18 but adds that it is to this day virtually unknown even in germany 131 in dutch edit in the netherlands pieter corneliszoon hooft introduced sonnets in the baroque style of which mijn lief mijn lief mijn lief soo sprack mijn lief mij toe presents a notable example of sound and word play 132 another of his sonnets dedicated to hugo grotius was later translated by edmund gosse 133 in later centuries the sonnet form was dropped and then returned to by successive waves of innovators in an attempt to breathe new life into dutch poetry when in their eyes it had lost its way for the generation of the 1880s it was jacques perk s sonnet sequence mathilde which served as a rallying cry and for a while in the early years of the new century martinus nijhoff wrote notable sonnets before turning to more modernistic models 134 following the second world war avant garde poets declared war on all formalism reacting particularly against the extreme subjectivity and self aggrandisement of representatives of the 1880s style like willem kloos who had once begun a sonnet in my deepest being i m a god in reaction lucebert satirised such writing in the sonnet with which his first collection opened but by the end of the 20th century formalist poets such as gerrit komrij and jan kal were writing sonnets again as part of their own reaction to the experimentalism of earlier decades 136 jewish languages edit for three millennia there has been a literature in the various languages developed by the scattered communities of jewish origin so far as the sonnet is concerned two languages were involved mostly written in the european areas where that form was taken up and taken elsewhere in the world by emigrants hebrew edit the hebrew name for a sonnet is shir zahav deriving from a numerological play on words literally golden song the consonants of zahav also stand for numbers adding up to fourteen so that the term can also mean song of fourteen lines 137 the first sonnets in medieval hebrew poetry were probably composed in rome by immanuel the roman around the year 1300 less than a century after the advent of the italian sonnet 138 139 38 sonnets are included in his maqama collection mahberot immanuel that combine elements of both the quantitative metre traditional to hebrew and arabic verse and italian syllabic metre predominantly dealing with love they were rhymed a b b a a b b a c d e c d e displaystyle mathrm abba abba cde cde 139 immanuel s work provided a ready model for the second wave of italo hebrew sonnet writers the first printed edition of mahberot immanuel appeared in brescia in 1492 followed by a second edition published in constantinople in 1535 the new crop therefore coincided with the adoption of the sonnet in other european literatures at the start of the 16th century and persisted into the baroque period of the following century with more than eighty poets taking up the form though there was now a shift of focus to religious themes love poetry was not excluded particularly in the sonnets of david okineira of salonika 140 the baroque practice of incorporating sonnets along with other verse into plays as had shakespeare in england and lope da vega in spain was also to be found in moses ben mordecai zacuto s yesod olam foundation of the world 1642 and in asirei ha tiqva prisoners of hope 1673 an allegorical play by joseph de la vega a further revival of the hebrew sonnet followed in the 18th century associated with samson cohen modon 1679 1727 moshe chaim luzzatto and his cousin ephraim luzzatto 1729 1792 who are regarded as founders of modern hebrew literature 141 that the form persisted into the 20th century was celebrated by shaul tchernichovsky in his ma\u1e25beret ha sonetot berlin 1923 in which appeared a sonnet of his own celebrating its continuity since the time of immanuel of rome thou art dear to me how dear to me sonetot o shir zahav 142 the same author was responsible for introducing the crown of sonnets into hebrew poetry yiddish edit yiddish the name given to a continuum of judaeo german dialects spoken particularly across eastern europe has had a literature since the middle ages the sonnet however arriving late in the surrounding slavic areas was at first viewed as an alien genre among jewish writers in yiddish its adoption came only slowly with greater access to secular educational and with emigration the first poets to use the form are credited as dovid kenigsberg 1891 1942 and fradl shtok the former published soneten lemberg 1913 and later his hundred sonnets hundert soneten vienna 1921 143 shtok emigrated to the us while young and began publishing poetry soon after her arrival in new york in 1910 144 in reality earlier sonnets dating from the 1890s were written in the us by morris vintshevski 1856 1932 and in vilnius those written by leib naidus starting from 1910 demonstrated the westward spreading influence of symbolist inspired modernism 145 those poets in europe who authored entire collections of sonnets include gershon peysekh vayland 1869 1942 published in warsaw in 1938 and 1939 146 yankev gotlib 1911 1945 published in kaunas in 1938 147 and the polish abraham nahum stencl whose londoner sonetn were published after his arrival in london in 1937 148 later examples of those writing substantial numbers of sonnets in the us number the scholar n b minkoff who included a sonnet cycle in lieder 1924 his first publication after immigrating 149 and aron glantz leyeles 1899 1968 who published a whole collection of poems in mediaeval forms in 1926 this included autumn a densely rhymed garland of fifteen sonnets 150 in 1932 yoysef leyzer kalushiner 1893 1968 published a whole book of sonnets in new york 151 he was followed by the little known m freed who had already published a sonnet collection the narcissi \u05e0\u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d9\u05e1\u05df czernowitz 1937 in bukovina before making his way to the us where he published an evening by the prut \u05de \u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05e8 new york 1942 152 later collections of sonnets include sonetn fun toye voye sonnets of chaos new york 1957 by yirmye hesheles 1910 2010 153 and mani leib s sonetn 1961 considered the crowning achievement of his work and one of the last great works of yiddish poetry 154 to these post war collections may be added meksike finf un draysik sonetn mexico 35 sonnets 1949 which was published in mexico city after austridan oystriak 1911 92 had fled there from europe in 1940 155 yiddish sonnets published in israel where the preferred language was hebrew were comparatively rare samuel jacob taubes 1898 1975 had already published religious sonnets in europe before emigrating to israel after a wandering literary career 156 shlomo roitman 1913 85 began writing in russia and published sonnet collections after his arrival in israel 157 slavic languages edit czech edit karel hynek m\u00e1cha the sonnet was introduced into czech literature at the beginning of the 19th century the first great czech sonneteer was j\u00e1n koll\u00e1r who wrote a cycle of sonnets named sl\u00e1vy dcera the daughter of sl\u00e1va the daughter of fame 158 while koll\u00e1r was slovak he was a supporter of pan slavism and wrote in czech as he disagreed that slovak should be a separate language koll\u00e1r s magnum opus was planned as a slavic epic poem as great as dante s divine comedy it consists of the prelude written in quantitative hexameters and sonnets the number of poems increased in subsequent editions and came up to 645 159 the greatest czech romantic poet karel hynek m\u00e1cha also wrote many sonnets in the second half of the 19th century jaroslav vrchlick\u00fd published sonety samot\u00e1\u0159e sonnets of a solitudinarian another poet who wrote many sonnets was josef svatopluk

as the crimean sonnets after the tsar sentenced him to exile in the crimean peninsula mickiewicz s sonnet sequence focuses heavily on the culture and islamic religion of the crimean tatars the sequence was translated into english by edna worthley underwood 163 russian edit in the 18th century after the westernizing reforms of peter the great russian poets among others alexander sumarokov and mikhail kheraskov began to experiment with sonnets but the form was soon overtaken in popularity by the more flexible onegin stanza this was used by alexander pushkin for his novel in verse eugene onegin and has also been described as the onegin sonnet since it consists of fourteen lines it is however aberrant in rhyme scheme and the number of stresses per line and is better described as having only a family resemblance to the sonnet 164 the form was adapted by other poets later including by mikhail lermontov in his narrative of the tambov treasurer s wife 165 slovenian edit in slovenia the sonnet became a national verse form using iambic pentameter with feminine rhymes based both on the italian endecasillabo and german iambic pentameter 166 the greatest slovenian poet france pre\u0161eren 167 wrote several sonnet sequences from 1831 onwards and is particularly known for his crown of sonnets sonetni venec a wreath of sonnets 168 many later poets followed him in using the sonnet form after the second world war slovenian poets wrote both traditional rhymed sonnets and postmodern ones unrhymed and in free verse among such writers are milan jesih 169 and ale\u0161 debeljak celtic languages edit in irish edit see irish poetry although sonnets had long been written in english by poets of irish heritage such as sir aubrey de vere oscar wilde william butler yeats tom kettle and patrick kavanagh the sonnet form failed to enter irish poetry in the irish language this changed however during the gaelic revival when dublin born liam g\u00f3gan 1891 1979 was dismissed from his post in the national museum of ireland and imprisoned at frongoch internment camp following the easter rising there he became the first poet to write sonnets in the irish language 170 in 2009 poet muiris sion\u00f3id published a complete translation of william shakespeare s 154 sonnets into irish under the title rotha m\u00f3r an ghr\u00e1 the great wheel of love 171 in an article about his translations sion\u00f3id wrote that irish poetic forms are completely different from those of other languages and that both the sonnet form and the iambic pentameter line had long been considered entirely unsuitable for composing poetry in irish in his translations soin\u00f3id chose to closely reproduce shakespeare s rhyme scheme and rhythms while rendering into irish 172 in welsh edit see welsh poetry according to jan morris when welsh poets speak of free verse they mean forms like the sonnet or the ode which obey the same rules as english poesy strict metres verse still honours the complex rules laid down for correct poetic composition 600 years ago 173 nevertheless several of the greatest recent welsh language poets have also written sonnets including welsh nationalist and traditionalist catholic poet saunders lewis 174 and far left poet thomas evan nicholas 175 indian languages edit in the indian subcontinent sonnets have been written in the assamese

suggested that cockrum make his character typhoon designed as a male into the woman of the group 3 cockrum liked the idea and outfitted typhoon with the black cat s costume a cape and a new haircut with white hair his collaborators feared that storm s white hair would make her look like a grandmother but cockrum confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young insisted on this aspect of her appearance 3 4 1975 1979 origin and early stories edit storm first appeared in 1975 in the comic book giant size x men 1 written by len wein and pencilled by dave cockrum 5 6 in this comic wein portrays a battle against the living island krakoa that results in the replacement of first generation x men of the 1960s by new x men 7 chris claremont followed up wein as the writer of the x men in 1975 citation needed the title of the series was changed to the uncanny x men three years later storm was initially written having trouble adjusting to western culture e g calling the obligation to wear clothing in public absurd 8 claremont remained the main writer of x men for the next 16 years and consequently wrote most of the publications containing storm following the dark phoenix saga storm becomes the most prominent character in the x men during claremont s tenure she is often a viewpoint character whose thought processes guide the narrative 9 she is the character who is most frequently represented in the claremont era appearing in 4 155 panels and the most frequently pictured on issue covers appearing on 97 of the 182 total issues in claremont s run 10 1980s punk look and loss of powers edit by the early 1980s x men was marvel s top selling comic title its sales were such that distributors and retailers began using an x men index rating each comic book publication by how many orders it garnered compared to that month s issue of x men 11 in this period claremont portrayed storm as a serene independent character in the uncanny x men 139 november 1980 claremont established her as the leader of the x men after cyclops takes a leave of absence 12 claremont also established a maternal relationship between storm and her 13 year old teammate kitty pryde a short story by claremont set during storm s childhood in kenya that ran in marvel team up 100 december 1980 establishes that when she was 12 years old storm saved a young black panther from racist thugs 13 this story would later become the basis for later writers to establish a deeper relationship between both characters 14 in the early 1980s adventures of storm written by claremont included a space opera arc in which the x men fight parasitic beings called the brood storm is infected with a brood egg and contemplates suicide but is saved at the last minute by the benign whale like acanti aliens 15 subsequently storm s fellow x man angel is abducted by a rogue mutant group called the morlocks the morlocks are subterranean mutant refugees living in the tunnels of the new york city sewer system and constitute an underclass of outcasts 16 the x men are outnumbered and storm is rendered sick by the morlock called plague to save kitty s life storm challenges the morlocks leader callisto in a duel to the death for the leadership of the morlocks callisto is presented as a complex character who rebels against her position of low social status despite storm s illness she defeats callisto by stabbing her with a knife callisto is saved through the efforts of a morlock healer and storm offers the morlocks refuge at the xavier mansion though they decline 17 storm is then made leader of the morlocks this fight with callisto has strong effects on storm s character who becomes more defiantly non conformist 18 following this incident storm has an encounter with yukio a ninja companion of wolverine s storm has a close and intimate bond with her 19 while the characters relationship was conceived of as romantic 20 it was relegated to subtext after marvel comics editor in chief jim shooter mandated that no same gender couples could be depicted at marvel 21 22 23 these experiences lead storm to drastically change her appearance storm s punk look by paul smith who called it a bad joke that got way out of hand 24 in the uncanny x men 173 october 1983 claremont and artist paul smith created a new look for storm replacing her old costume with a punk fashion aesthetic a black leather top and pants with spikes and a mohawk 25 the change in appearance was inspired by the decision of colleague walt simonson to shave off his beard and mustache while on vacation with his wife x men editor louise simonson upon their return simonson s daughter julie upset at her father s new appearance ran from the room 26 when the editors decided to change storm s appearance smith submitted a number of designs to them explaining in a 2008 interview i did a number of portraits all quite lovely and feminine as a joke i included a shot of her as mr t you know the kind of shot where they have to go the other way weezie x men editor louise simonson s response they re going to hang us whichever way we go let s commit the murder i argued it was a joke and a monstrously bad idea but given my departure following 175 was set prior to beginning my run my vote didn t count so i did what i could with what i had left so we went with the mohawk but once you get into the whole leather and stud thing it was a bad joke that got way out of hand 24 27 julie simonson s reaction to her father s new appearance would be mirrored in x man kitty pryde s heartbroken rejection of storm s new look 26 these changes alienate her from kitty for a time comics scholar andre m carrington views this incident as a challenge to the stereotype of black women as universal caregivers demonstrating unconscious expectations of race and gender 28 a year later claremont wrote an arc in which fellow mutant forge develops a mutant power neutralizing gun the intended target is another x man rogue but storm is hit instead taking away her powers forge takes her back to his home in dallas texas to recover they fall in love but when she learns that forge built the weapon that took her powers she is heartbroken and leaves him 29 by 1986 the question arises of whether the x men should be led by storm or by cyclops who was now married to madelyne pryor and an expectant husband the two settle the matter in a duel in the danger room that saw storm victorious 30 j andrew deman describes other instances in which storm establishes her power and authority by commanding or overruling highly masculinized white characters such as wolverine 31 marc silvestri became the primary artist of uncanny x men in the late 1980s regarding storm he said that she has a certain attitude that s tough to capture without dropping into clich\u00e9s and certain poses you have to have an unusual energy level the day you have to draw storm 32 during the 1988 fall of the mutants storyline storm is trapped in another dimension with forge who restores her elemental powers following her rejoining the x men they fight a demonic enemy called the adversary while they defeat the adversary the battle creates the public appearance that the x men have all died in fact they have survived with the help of a celestial being known as roma roma casts a spell on them to be invisible to electronic equipment 33 the x men set up new headquarters in a small frontier village in the australian outback after expelling a group of mutant hunting cyborgs called reavers who had been living there storm is

november 1993 before he wrote a reconciliation between the deeply pained storm and forge 41 john romita jr provided most of the drawing for the series in 1993 42 there were multiple crossovers among the various x men comic series in this period that featured storm as one character among others such as x cutioner s song fatal attractions and phalanx covenant in 1994 joe madureira took over as the main penciler of uncanny x men 43 in 1995 all of the x men titles were temporarily replaced by an alternate reality storyline called age of apocalypse storm was a relatively minor character in this new reality when the original series were restored lobdell continued an arc again pitting the x men against the morlocks as claremont did with callisto in 1983 lobdell has storm ending the battle by wounding her opponent in the heart here storm rips out one heart of the two hearted morlock girl marrow which has a bomb affixed to it 44 in february 1996 storm appeared in her first miniseries the

renewed interactions storm compares black panther s sense of commitment and certainty to that of magneto the issue establishes that storm continues to believe that someday she and t challa may have a permanent marriage but this must be deferred because of t challa s exclusive commitment to his nation 48 priest later said that he believed the two characters had a profound love affair but that in his view they could never have a permanent relationship precisely because storm is the only human being on the planet panther cannot b s she sees right through him knows him far too intimately 49 chris claremont returned to the character in his title x treme x men beginning in july 2001 storm was written as the leader of this team and the central character of the book until its end in issue 46

celebrities worldwide real life figures such as george w bush fidel castro nelson mandela and oprah winfrey are depicted as attending the wedding as well as many marvel superheroes 60 some critics and fans felt that the marriage was forced or rushed rather than developing organically hudlin the writer responded that the event was set up by earlier storylines and that some of the criticisms may have been motivated by the desire to see storm in a relationship with a character of long standing popularity such as wolverine 49 subsequent to the marriage storm has many adventures with black panther and she temporarily leaves the x men she is a featured character throughout the remainder of reginald hudlin s run from 2006 to 2009 61 in 2007 when mister fantastic and the invisible woman take time

elemental power and sexually remote despite her fetishistic costume 98 he argues that she has a quasi maternal role with many of x men and often acts to resolve their various contradictions and disputes carol cooper points out that storm is often noted by other prominent characters for her magnetic attractiveness and sex appeal but that this is always made secondary to her other qualities and capacities 99 margaret galvan sees jean grey as phoenix as a character foil to storm because grey loses control of her enormous powers and lapses into narcissism while storm avoids this pitfall galvan argues that this is an allegory for the transformation of liberal feminism from the 1970s to the 1980s 100 ramzi fawaz argues that storm is defined by a capacity to balance collective intimacies with her need for personal autonomy and that this mirrors her superpowers connection to the unpredictability of the natural world 101 fawaz argues that storm s claustrophobia also links her

recognizes the potential in her however when xavier is attacked mentally by amahl farouk the shadow king the two men are preoccupied with their battle allowing the girl to escape both xavier and the shadow king recognize storm as the young girl later 105 ever since her inception in 1975 storm s biography has largely stayed the same some reinterpretations were made in 2005 and 2006 when writers

potential has not yet been realized and on one occasion the super giant stated that storm was an omega level mutate grouping and targeting her with omega level mutants such as iceman and rachel grey 168 her omega level status was eventually confirmed 169 170 171 themes and motifs edit storm is among the most famous black female superheroes and as a result has been widely viewed as an icon of third wave feminism and intersectionality conceptual innovations that address the intertwining of race and gender 172 gladys l knight author of female action heroes a guide to women in comics video games film and television 2010 wrote that two defining aspects of her persona are her racial identity and her social status as a mutant 173 the x men have symbolically represented marginalized minorities and the debut of the x men series coincided with the civil rights movement in which their plight as mutants mirrored that of african americans 173 storm s creation in particular was during the heyday of blaxploitation films 173 j andrew deman argues that her early appearances are somewhat stereotypical and demonstrate sexual exoticism catering to the male gaze 174 carol cooper also views the early appearances of the character as emblematic of the mythic earth mother matriarch figure critiqued by many black feminists as both unrealistic and racist in its glib projection of inhuman perfection 175 while storm has always been presented as a black woman she is also often drawn with more european features and canonically has blue eyes some have criticized these choices as concessions to aesthetic standards of white americans 176 however ramzi fawaz writes ororo is a character with few if any genuine antecedents in american superhero comic books a superpowered black woman who grew up a vagabond 177 many scholars such as deborah whaley have argued that in subsequent appearances she overcomes these stereotypical origins to become a visionary social subject that propels social change 175 storm s leadership of the x men has been read as a utopian vision of overcoming racism and sexism fawaz argues that storm represents a new affective relation between the teammates that derails the heterosexual order that had prevailed in the original team 178 fawaz interprets storm as embodying the black female disco diva that dominated gay and african american visual culture by means of her costume and hyperbolic performance of an african goddess persona 177 fawaz is particularly interested in storm s bond with jean grey in the mid 1970s which he sees as a representation of radical political attempts to articulate cross racial alliances and mutual recognition between women 179 storm also unites african american and continental african notions of black identity particularly in the storyline which she takes a leave of absence of the x men in order to return to her homeland for a year titled lifedeath ii 180 while deman writes that some of the depictions of africa are stereotypical the illustration of a diasporic identity and its links to ancestry are potentially progressive for readers 181 since then storm has become a notable fictional example of a contemporary african woman in 2014 karen attiah of the washington post asserted african women are having a bit of a moment in american pop culture from nigerian author chimamanda adichie to ghanaian nigerian author taiye selasie to kenyan star lupita nyong o african immigrant women are finding that their stories and performances resonate with american audiences now a fictional woman is joining their ranks ororo munroe known as storm a member of marvel s x men team even as a supporting character or member of an ensemble storm s done it all she s been an african queen a street thief an x men team leader and the headmistress of the jean grey school of higher learning in the world of comic book fantasy where black characters are scarce the fact that storm was one of the most powerful mutants in the x men universe was a point of pride growing up 182 supporting characters edit allies edit storm has notable bonds with all of the main x men in the first period that she led the team its line up comprised wolverine nightcrawler colossus rogue and kitty pryde 183 in particular she has a maternal connection to pryde particularly in stories of the 1970s she has a close friendship with jean grey 184 ramzi fawaz views this friendship as an allegory for bonds between the liberation projects of black women and white women 185 in stories of the 2010s she works together with the crew an all black superhero team that also includes her former husband black panther luke cage and misty knight her friendship with cage and knight had been previously established in the 1970s 180 romantic relationships and sexuality edit storm had a long standing relationship with forge that culminated in his proposal of marriage which he later withdrew as a result of misinterpreting her hesitation storm s longest and most prominent relationship is with black panther in 2006 during reginald hudlin s authorship of black panther storm marries black panther and she appeared as a prominent supporting character in many subsequent storylines readers and critics compared the wedding to the relationship of jay z and beyonc\u00e9 although they did not marry until two years later 186 the marriage was later annulled during the events of avengers vs x men however storm has resumed the relationship in later storylines storm also had a significant romantic relationship with wolverine in the claremont period storm s bisexuality is implied she has a close relationship with yukio a partner of wolverine s 187 while the characters relationship was conceived of as romantic 20 it was relegated to subtext after marvel comics editor in chief jim shooter mandated that no same gender couples could be depicted in comic books 21 22 23 because of this relationship some secondary sources identify storm as bisexual 188 generally speaking later storylines do not explore this aspect of storm s character in 1994 uncanny x men 312 revisited the relationship between storm and yukio the narrator of the story describes them as more than friends less than sisters these two are kindred spirits 189 cultural impact and legacy edit storm was one of the first black superheroes in mainstream comic books and the second black female superhero in marvel comics after misty knight who debuted in march 1975 173 she was the third black female superhero in mainstream comics dc had previously introduced nubia a supporting character for wonder woman in 1973 190 in marvel comics other preceding black characters with superpowers were black panther 1966 hobie brown the prowler and

miracle prot\u00e9g\u00e9 shilo norman 1973 since her creation storm has remained one of the most successful and recognizable black superheroes 191 storm is the first black leader of a marvel superhero team as well as the first female leader of a marvel superhero team 192 critical reception edit andrew wheeler of comicsalliance described storm as the first major black female superhero stating storm was designed to stand out from previous super women and not only by dint of her race she also had long white hair and strange oval irises and arguably the most formidable power set in the new team from the start her weather control powers allowed her to summon raging winds and lightning strikes she was a heavyweight who had been worshiped as a goddess and there was never any question of her using her powers only to defend or evade she wasn t introduced as a damsel and she wasn t introduced as a love interest 193 alex abad santos of vox called storm one of marvel s most iconic characters saying marvel for the past couple of years has built up a notably diverse cast of heroes and started to get serious about featuring its female leads but arguably the most iconic non white character the company has introduced to date is storm aka ororo munroe who was first introduced in 1975 clocking in at 5 11 with white hair black skin and the power to control the weather storm was startling beautiful and something readers had never seen before she s a big reason writer greg pak picked up comic books 194 ashanti el of screen rant referred to storm as a veteran x men hero and weather goddess writing storm s fame in media stems from her unmatched representation as a black woman in a time when the majority of superheroes were only white men in capes ororo broke the mold and proved that diversity in comics was possible and lucrative with the x men starring in several pop culture landmarks including the popular 90s animated series a trailblazer among trailblazers storm s roles in comics helped to usher in a new wave of comic book heroes like riri williams lunella lafayette and shuri cosplayers and fans also marvel at the mutant s stylish costumes including the iconic self empowering 80s mohawk look 195 danielle broadway of the mary sue stated the marvel character storm is not only a staple of the x men franchise but also a notorious fan favorite from her epic weather control powers to her unique style storm has stolen the hearts of many created by writer len wein and artist dave cockrum she s one of the first and only black woman superheroes in marvel comics she illustrates what it means to be a black woman as she fights to oppose stereotypes violence and commodification 196 sara century of syfy said it s no secret that ororo munroe is a fangrrls favorite this is a woman that has been around the world and even a pretty fair amount of the galaxy yet she remains perhaps the most emotionally grounded x man she s an omega level mutant and finds herself regularly seated at tables of marvel s most powerful players she has done everything from pickpocket to queen she is kind of the best 197 david harth of cbr com wrote storm has been on a long strange trip throughout her life in comics one that s always seen her on an upward trajectory from a thief on the streets of cairo to a goddess on the african plains to a superhero and leader of the highest caliber ororo munroe has proven nothing can hold her back storm remained one of the most beloved x men and an irreplaceable part of the team s mythos debuting on a stacked x men team she was still able to stand out marvel and the creators who worked on storm did their best to make her a better character creating a superhero unlike any other 198 chris arrant of newsarama wrote while her mutant ability to control the weather is a pivotal part of her thanks to the writers and artists that have added layers to her character it s storm the woman and her often dueling qualities of tenacity anger forgiveness and compassion that have forged her into a titan of modern fiction and cemented her into the bedrock foundation of marvel comics most important characters 199 ign stated storm s ability to manipulate and harness the weather makes her one of the most powerful mutants on earth but power like that comes at a great cost storm lives every day in a state of carefully maintained composure too much stress could be deadly for everyone around her fans have seen storm as a thief an x man a fighter and even a queen through it all she remains one of the most relatable

sunday the day of the sun is derived from hellenistic astrology where the seven planets known in english as saturn jupiter mars the sun venus mercury and the moon each had an hour of the day assigned to them and the planet which was regent during the first hour of any day of the week gave its name to that day during the 1st and 2nd centuries the week of seven days was introduced into rome from egypt and the roman names of the planets were given to each successive day germanic peoples seem to have adopted the week as a division of time from the romans but they changed the roman names into

is called number one as counting starts from zero the first day saturday is denoted as day zero sunday in christianity edit christian usage edit the ancient romans traditionally used the eight day nundinal cycle a market week but in the time of augustus in the 1st century ad a seven day week also came into use in the gospels the women are described as coming to the empty tomb \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2

justin martyr in the mid 2nd century mentions memoirs of the apostles as being read on the day called that of the sun sunday alongside the writings of the prophets 13 on 7 march 321 constantine i rome s first christian emperor decreed that sunday would be observed as the roman day of rest 14 on the venerable day of the sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest and let all workshops be closed in the country however persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits because it often happens that another day is not so suitable for grain sowing or vine planting lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven should be lost 15 despite the official adoption of sunday as a day of rest by constantine the seven day week and the nundinal cycle continued to be used side by side until at least the calendar of 354 and probably later 16 in 363 canon 29 of the council of laodicea prohibited observance of the jewish sabbath saturday and encouraged christians to work on saturday and rest on the lord s day sunday 17 the fact that the canon had to be issued at all is an indication that adoption of constantine s decree of 321 was still not universal not even among christians it also indicates that jews were observing the sabbath on saturday modern practices edit first day sabbatarians including christians of the methodist baptist and reformed presbyterian and congregationalist traditions observe sunday as the sabbath a day devoted to the worship of god at church the attendance of sunday school a service of worship in the morning and evening as well as a day of rest meaning that people are free from servile labour and should refrain from trading buying and selling except when necessary 18 19 for most christians the custom and obligation of sunday rest is not as strict a minority of christians do not regard the day they attend church as important so long as they attend there is considerable variation in the observance of sabbath rituals and restrictions but some cessation of normal weekday activities is customary many christians today observe sunday as a day of church attendance in roman catholic practice on sundays church members are bound to come together into one place so that by hearing the word of god and taking part in the eucharist they may call to mind the passion the

perform communal masbuta baptism every sunday 22 common occurrences on sunday edit in government and business edit in the united states and canada most government offices are closed on both saturday and sunday the practice of offices closing on sunday in government and in some rural areas of the united states stem from a system of blue laws 23 blue laws were established in the early puritan days which forbade secular activities on sunday and were rigidly enforced some public activities are still regulated by these blue laws in the 21st century 24 in 1985 twenty two states in which religious fundamentalism remained strong maintained general restrictions on sunday behavior 25 in oklahoma for example it is stated oklahoma s statutes state that acts deemed useless and serious interruptions of the repose and religious liberty of the community such as trades manufacturing mechanical employment horse racing and gaming are forbidden public selling of commodities other than necessary foods and drinks medicine ice and surgical and burial equipment and other necessities can legally be prohibited on sunday in oklahoma a fine not to exceed twenty five dollars may be imposed on individuals for each offense 25 because of these blue laws many private sector retail businesses open later and close earlier on sunday or do not open at all many countries particularly in europe such as sweden

regular weekly music patterns on sunday morning or sunday evening in the united kingdom there is a sunday tradition of chart shows on bbc radio 1 and commercial radio this originates in the broadcast

august 1969 and became a hit reaching no 4 on the u s billboard 200 25 the band s performance at woodstock and the follow up sound track and movie introduced them to an international audience and

band was also helped by the return of a recuperated chepito areas and the assistance of coke escovedo in the percussion section enhancing the band s sound further was the support of popular bay area group tower of power s horn section luis gasca of malo and other session musicians which added to both percussion and vocals injecting more energy to the proceedings santana iii was another success reaching no 1 on the album charts selling two million copies and yielding the hit no one to depend on tension between members of the band continued however along with musical differences drug use became a problem and santana was deeply worried that it was affecting the band s performance coke escovedo encouraged santana to take more control of the band s musical direction much to the dismay of some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort also financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of stan marcum whom bill graham criticized as being incompetent growing resentments between santana and michael carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms james mingo lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement

kardashian", "many christian parents have named their sons with the biblical saint name of joseph in honour of saint joseph father of jesus a saint s name which is usually also a biblical name is the name of a saint given to individuals at their baptism or confirmation within the catholic church as well as in certain parts of the eastern orthodox church the oriental orthodox churches lutheran churches and anglican communion it is believed that the saint whose name is chosen will serve as a special patron to protect and guide and will be the heavenly intercessor for the individual who bears his or her name girls are often named with the biblical saint name elizabeth by christian parents in honour of saint elizabeth the mother of the last prophet john the baptist the custom of giving the name of a saint originated with the practice of individuals who converted to christianity taking a new christian name at their baptism 1 the custom was popular in france and germany during the middle ages and is still customary in continental europe 2 in many english speaking countries however it is more common for the saint s name to be adopted upon confirmation in which case it would usually not be part of one s legal name under the current code of canon law of the catholic church canon 855 states parents sponsors and parish priests are to take care that a name is not given which is foreign to christian sentiment 3 which would simply prohibit a baptismal name being something in the vein of satan lucifer or death 4 however that was not always the case in the 1917 code of canon law canon 761 required pastors to ensure the baptismal name was a christian name such as christian grace or faith therefore what is now called a given name was once referred to as a christian name and originated with the pagans of europe who discarded their pagan names for biblical ones when they converted to christianity and participated in baptism an additional saint s name must be given when the former is impossible 5 in some christian countries the saint s day of the person s name is celebrated as a birthday is in other countries cf name day a child may also be named after the saint whose feast is the child s birthday in places where christians are in the minority and may face persecution parents may give both a christian saint s name and a secular name to a child allowing them to use the saint s name for religious purposes and the secular name for all other purposes this is especially common in cultures such as in south korea where traditional given names do not line up with

the dutch west india company the society was chartered to manage and defend the colony the planters or more accurately slaveowners of the colony relied heavily on violently forcing enslaved african slaves to cultivate harvest and process the commodity crops of coffee cocoa sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers approximately 300 000 enslaved africans were taken to suriname during the transatlantic slave trade from the mid 1600s to the early 1800s these slaveowners or planters treatment of the enslaved africans was notoriously brutal even by the standards of the time 25 historian c r boxer wrote that man s inhumanity to man just about reached its limits in surinam 26 and many enslaved africans escaped the forced labour camps known as plantations even after slavery was abolished enslaved africans received no compensation or reparations and faced violence and terror from the colonial settler dutch in november 1795 the society was nationalized by the batavian republic and from

that is pale skinned negroes and in dutch as marrons the maroons gradually developed several independent tribes through a process of ethnogenesis as they were from different african ethnicities these tribes include the saramaka paramaka ndyuka or aukan kwinti aluku or boni and matawai the maroons often raided forced labour plantations to recruit new members from the enslaved and capture women as well as to acquire weapons food and supplies they sometimes killed the dutch slave owning planters and their families in the raids to free their enslaved people from the brutal violence by the slave owning families european colonists built defences which were significant enough that they were shown on 18th century maps 27 the dutch colonists also mounted armed campaigns against the maroons who generally escaped the harsh enslavement by the dutch through the rainforest which they knew much better than the colonisers did to end hostilities in the 18th century the european colonial authorities signed several peace treaties with different tribes they were forced to grant the maroons sovereign status and trade rights in their inland territories who have fought for their autonomy abolition of slavery edit from 1861 to 1863 with the american civil war underway and enslaved people escaping to northern territory controlled by the union united states president abraham lincoln and his

american emigration to and colonization of the dutch colony of suriname nothing came of the idea which was dropped after 1864 28 the netherlands abolished slavery in suriname in 1863 under a gradual process that required slaves to work on plantations for 10 transition years for minimal pay which was considered as partial compensation for their masters 29 30 after that transition period expired in 1873 most freedmen largely abandoned the plantations where they had worked for several generations in favour of the capital city paramaribo some of them were able to purchase the plantations they worked on especially in the district of para and coronie their descendants still live on those grounds today several plantation owners did not pay their former enslaved workers the pay they owed them

traits at least in their literary forms they also have a great many characteristics in common 5 one of these is age the typical bond girl is in her early to mid twenties roughly ten years younger than

the greatest degree from the template dressing in white leather doeskin sandals appearing more tanned sporting a soft brigitte bardot haircut and giving no indication of widely spaced features 21 the departure may be due to the unusual circumstances behind the writing of the novel thunderball in which domino appears even domino however wears rather masculine jewellery 22 page needed the best known characteristic of bond girls apart from their uniform beauty is their pattern of sexually suggestive names such as pussy galore names with less obvious meanings are sometimes explained in the novels

honey ryder was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance 25 pussy galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle 26 while there is no such clear cut trauma in solitaire s early life there are suggestions that she too avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past kissy suzuki reports to bond that during her brief career in hollywood when she was 17 they thought that because i am japanese i am some sort of an animal and that my body is for everyone 27 the implication is often that these violent episodes have turned these bond girls against men though upon encountering bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly this trope reaches an extreme level in goldfinger where pussy galore is portrayed as a lesbian when she first meets bond but at the end of the novel she sleeps with him when in bed he says to her they told me you only liked women she replies i never met a man before 26 in fleming s novels many bond girls have some sort of independent job or even career often one that was considered inappropriate for women in the 1950s lynd brand tatiana romanova mary ann russell and mary goodnight are in intelligence or law enforcement work those who are criminals such as case and galore tend to be similarly independent minded in how they approach their work the latter even running her own syndicate

devoted to fleming despite his repeated unfaithfulness she died in an air raid in 1944 devastating fleming who called wright too good to be true 28 in film edit ursula andress as honey ryder in dr no

on her by drowning in a lift in a building under renovation in venice 42 43 with the exception of these two doomed bond girls it is never explained why bond s love interest in one film is gone by the

becoming a full fledged bond girl in the man with the golden gun citation needed effect on career edit the role of a bond girl as it has evolved in the films is typically a high profile part that can sometimes give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses although a number of bond girls were well established beforehand for instance diana rigg and honor blackman were both cast as bond

so instead he considered raquel welch after seeing her on the cover of the october 1964 issue of life magazine welch however was hired by richard zanuck of 20th century fox to appear in the film fantastic voyage the same year instead 44 french actress claudine auger was ultimately cast in the role thunderball launched auger into a successful european film career but did little for her in the united states 45 the producers encountered difficulty in casting the female lead in casino royale 2006 due to the perception among many leading actresses that appearing in a james bond film could hinder their careers catherine zeta jones was one of several actresses who declined a role in the film however there is plenty of evidence to the contrary with several former bond girls going on to have very high profile acting careers 46 of the earlier actresses ursula andress and honor blackman both had well regarded careers and jane seymour who was an unknown when she was cast in live and let

mythological figure regarded as a previous life of the buddha in buddhist texts sumedha is a previous life of gotama buddha p\u0101li sanskrit gautama in which he declares his intention to become a buddha buddhist texts describe that this takes place when gotama buddha is still a buddha to be pali bodhisatta sanskrit bodhisattva traditions regard sumedha s life as the beginning of the spiritual journey leading up to the attainment of buddhahood by gotama in his last life a journey which takes place through many lifetimes born in a brahmin family sumedha begins to live as an ascetic in the mountains one day he meets d\u012bpankara buddha sanskrit d\u012bpa\u1e43kara and offers his own body for him to walk over during this sacrifice he makes a vow that he also will be a buddha in a future lifetime which is confirmed by d\u012bpankara through a prophecy the encounter between sumedha and d\u012bpankara buddha is the oldest buddhist story known which deals with the path of a bodhisatta and the story has been described as the therav\u0101din interpretation of this ideal it is the most detailed story of a previous life of the buddha and is one of the most popular stories in buddhist art it is depicted in many therav\u0101din temples and is at least alluded to in innumerable buddhist works sumedha s story has often been raised by therav\u0101da buddhists as an example of selfless service origins edit the accounts of sumedha and d\u012bpankara buddha have been connected to the area northwest of india sumedha s life is described in the p\u0101li buddhava\u1e43sa and j\u0101taka the latter being based on the former the sanskrit textual traditions relate sumedha s life as well the sanskrit tradition accounts are very similar to those of the p\u0101li which has led indologists kenneth norman and richard gombrich to argue that the accounts can be dated back to pre sectarian buddhism possibly as early as a century after the buddha on the other hand buddhist studies scholar jan nattier argues that d\u012bpankara buddha s absence in the earliest p\u0101li discourses pali sutta sanskrit s\u016btra indicates that traditions about d\u012bpankara only became current several centuries after the buddha buddhist studies scholar naomi appleton states parts of the biographical material were fixed no later than the sixth century ce chinese buddhist pilgrims such as faxian 337 c 422 ce identified the place where sumedha would have met d\u012bpankara buddha as nagar\u0101h\u0101ra afghanistan now called nangarhar faxian reported a shrine for d\u012bpankara there apparently it was important for gandh\u0101ran buddhists to claim that their country was the origin of gotama buddha s spiritual life since most of the depictions of sumedha s account have been found in the area northwest of india especially gandh\u0101ra it has been suggested that the story developed there however the motif of the spreading of hair see encounter with d\u012bpankara buddha and role in buddhism has also been found in the ajant\u0101 and n\u0101land\u0101 areas and there is some evidence that the story was common in ajant\u0101 buddhist studies scholar karen derris has pointed out that the buddhava\u1e43sa has received relatively little scholarly attention due to mainstream scholars focus on early p\u0101li texts and being prejudiced against mythological accounts of later origin accounts edit early life edit in the p\u0101li texts sumedha is said to have lived four incalculable eons and a hundred thousand normal eons ago 10 in what most texts describe as gotama buddha s own memories an account is given of sumedha s life in the voice of the first person sumedha is born in amaravat\u012b in a brahmin family of noble birth 13 after having grown up he realizes that life is full of suffering such as sickness and death and he sets out to find a state beyond death 14 he realizes he cannot take his wealth in the afterlife and therefore donates it all becoming a type of ascetic wearing matted hair pali ja\u1e6dila 15 he begins to live on the dhammaka mountain in the himalayas he starts to observe strict discipline choosing only to live under trees and live on fruits the texts say that his self cultivation helps him to attain the highest knowledge and develop great yogic power like flying 19 he is depicted as being so immersed in yogic practice that he does not notice the portents that a buddha has arisen in the world note 1 encounter with d\u012bpankara buddha edit one day while traveling to the city of rammavat\u012b he sees people preparing a road for d\u012bpankara buddha to travel on d\u012bpankara being the first of twenty four buddhas that sumedha will meet before becoming a buddha himself being joyful on hearing the word buddha sumedha takes responsibility for a part of the road which has not been done yet but he does not manage to finish it in time for d\u012bpankara 23 since he does not want to use his psychic powers to repair the road sumedha prostrates himself in the mud in front of d\u012bpankara buddha and his following as a human bridge 24 note 2 he spreads his hair his deer skin and bark garment on the mud to cover it fully later texts would come to see this is an advanced stage in the development of gotama the buddha to be in that he fully dedicates himself to buddhahood not only in mind and in speech but also physically in this manner he pays homage to d\u012bpankara buddha and helps him and the monks to cross the mud unsullied this is regarded as a sacrifice of sumedha s life in that it entails many monks walking over him and him possibly dying in the process while doing so sumedha then pronounces a specific vow pali abhinih\u0101ra sanskrit p\u016brvapra\u1e47idh\u0101na that in the future he too will become a buddha 10 before walking over sumedha s body d\u012bpankara stops before him and makes a prophecy pali veyyakara\u1e47a sanskrit vy\u0101kara\u1e47a that sumedha s wish will come true in a future lifetime he will then become the buddha called s\u0101kyamuni sanskrit \u015b\u0101kyamuni 30 d\u012bpankara also mentions several details of the future buddha s life such as the names of his parents and main disciples when d\u012bpankara makes this statement many devotees who believe they cannot yet attain enlightenment under d\u012bpankara vow that they will attain it under the next buddha s\u0101kyamuni 10 after the prediction with sumedha still lying in the mud d\u012bpankara buddha and his following of monks circumambulate around sumedha and in some stories offer flowers as a sign of respect and to celebrate sumedha s future buddhahood meanwhile deities are depicted as approving of the prophecy like a divine chorus that give notice of his pending buddhahood a subservient role typical for buddhist cosmology the text reveals that many of the onlookers later become followers of gotama buddha in his final lifetime after his enlightenment according to the wish they made specifically they are reborn as the disciples called the kassapa brothers sanskrit k\u0101\u015byapa and their followers the motif that people who formerly encountered d\u012bpankara buddha become enlightened under another buddha gotama indicates that each buddha is regarded as continuing upon the work left unfinished by the previous buddhas response to the prophecy edit sumedha and the buddha d\u012bpankara near the city produced in thailand sumedha makes his vow as a buddha to be pali bodhisatta sanskrit bodhisattva because of the concern he has with other living beings the story relates that sumedha could have attained personal enlightenment at the time of meeting d\u012bpankara but chooses to strive to become a buddha instead 35 10 inspired by d\u012bpankara s example he feels he has the duty to strive for the highest accomplishment to become a buddha 10 after the prophecy is made sumedha reflects on the qualities he needs to accomplish buddhahood called the perfections pali p\u0101ram\u012b sanskrit p\u0101ramit\u0101 10 and concludes which are most important beginning with the perfection of giving 36 with sumedha having reflected on these perfections an earthquake follows in buddhist studies scholar kate crosby s words the whole universe confirms the future success of his vow this causes panic among the inhabitants but d\u012bpankara explains to them there is no reason for dismay the texts conclude with sumedha returning to the himalayas sumedha continues his spiritual journey through many lifetimes millions of lifetimes and billions of years every time he meets another buddha he performs an act of devotion and renews his bodhisatta vow to become one himself 40 all the while he develops his perfections further as each of the buddhas he meets inspires him to pursue buddhahood further and in the process adds something unique to the buddha to be s identity traditionally the rest of the j\u0101takas are also understood to depict the period between sumedha s bodhisatta vow and his eventual enlightenment as a buddha one of the more well known tales of a previous life is that of prince vessantara sanskrit vi\u015bvantara part of the j\u0101taka collection who famously gives his wealth wife and children away to attain buddhahood 10 other motifs edit in several chinese buddhist texts as well as the sanskrit mah\u0101vastu sumedha is called megha in several other chinese and sanskrit texts including the divyavad\u0101na he is called sumati the spelling sumegha also occurs in the p\u0101li apad\u0101na and \u0101gamas sumedha receives or buys blue lotus flowers from a young brahmin girl called sumitt\u0101 he later offers the flowers to d\u012bpankara buddha throwing them in the air 46 sumitt\u0101 takes a vow that she may be reborn as the wife of sumedha in a future life which is confirmed by a prediction by d\u012bpankara buddha later sumitt\u0101 is reborn as yasodhar\u0101 sanskrit ya\u015bodhar\u0101 the wife of prince siddhattha who later becomes gotama buddha in some versions of the story yasodhar\u0101 only gives the flowers to sumedha on the condition that he join her in pledging to be reborn as a couple in future lives note 3 yasodhar\u0101 is depicted in many gandh\u0101ran bas reliefs and statues alongside sumedha and d\u012bpankara buddha 52 in the apad\u0101na the divy\u0101vad\u0101na and the mah\u0101vastu sumedha also has a friend called meghadatta or mati the texts relate that the friend does much bad karma and is reborn in hell for many lifetimes as a result he is reborn in the time of gotama buddha as his disciple dhammaruci sanskrit dharmaruci medieval post canonical p\u0101li texts from burmese thai sinhalese and kh\u00fcn vernacular traditions describe an even earlier period in the spiritual path of gotama buddha relating about lives even prior to that of sumedha during which he not yet received confirmations of his vow from other buddhas 54 in this pre sumedha narrative tradition the encounter between sumedha and d\u012bpankara is seen as an advanced stage on the spiritual path of gotama buddha as opposed to a beginning these narratives depict a more gradual process of development and do not regard the beginning of the spiritual path of gotama buddha as a single revolutionary event because of that they offer a perspective which diminishes the importance of the encounter between sumedha and buddha d\u012bpankara for example the pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sa j\u0101taka collection that circulated in southeast asia relates about a previous life of sumedha in the time of a previous buddha also called d\u012bpankara in this lifetime sumedha already has the wish to become a buddha but cannot receive the prophecy from this d\u012bpankara buddha because in this lifetime sumedha is a woman this d\u012bpankara hears of the woman s wish who is his stepsister and lets her know that she will be able to receive the prediction later when she is born as the male sumedha during the time of the next d\u012bpankara there is debate among scholars whether this story should be interpreted as empowering women to become bodhisattas or affirming the status quo of women being unable to access the bodhisatta path archaeologist maurizio taddei has noted that in many gandharan art depictions sumedha s life is linked to that of r\u0101hula the son of the buddha the buddha giving his spiritual heritage to his son is compared to that of sumedha allowing the buddha d\u012bpankara to walk over him and d\u012bpankara making the prophecy both the figure of gotama buddha giving his inheritance to his son and the figure of d\u012bpankara buddha giving his inheritance of buddhahood to sumedha are depicted with flames emitting from their bodies both scenes are depictions of inheritance filial and disciple piety both may have been considered by fifth century buddhists to be representations of eager youth textual interpretation edit relief with buddha gotama meditating top and buddha d\u012bpankara meeting sumedha bottom gandharan region kushan period second third century ce sumedha is a powerful spiritual figure who is depicted as striving with willpower to attain the reality beyond painful rebirth and in the process is willing to discard his filthy body for the higher good the story of the encounter is meant to evoke respect for gotama buddha but also meant as an encouragement for those who strive for enlightenment in a future lifetime 10 62 it could have been used to encourage devotees to aspire to be reborn under metteyya sanskrit maitreya believed by buddhists to be the future buddha furthermore the story of sumedha as well as many j\u0101taka stories indicate that the path of a buddha to be is superior and more heroic than that of striving for only personal enlightenment 10 the story of sumedha meeting d\u012bpankara has a strong devotional ethos through the motif of the prophecy d\u012bpankara not only shows his complete cognizance of cosmos in the words of comparative religion scholar eviatar shulman but also that the buddha gotama and the buddhas that have preceded him are ultimately of the same substance sumedha is depicted as the buddha seed pali buddhabh\u012bja\u1e45gura that will eventually develop into a fully enlightened buddha just like all the other buddhas thus sumedha s prophecy not only shows the future personal attainment of gotama buddha but also reveals a cosmic structure the story of sumedha shows that buddhas make other buddhas or as buddhist studies scholar steven collins puts it e ach buddha is connected with others in a complex and interwoven pattern of predictions and recollections in addition sumedha s sacrifice of his body as a sort of bridge can be interpreted as a symbol for the passing of buddhism from one age to the next since d\u012bpankara s approval of sumedha is a pattern that occurs with every buddha before attaining buddhahood it becomes paradigmatic and reoccurring it can therefore be regarded as sacred time in contrast with profane single events following the theory of historian mircea eliade collins does point out that sumedha s account in the buddhava\u1e43sa depicts both repetitive and non repetitive time though the paths of the bodhisattas and buddhas are depicted as repetitive in nature time in the cycle of rebirth of living beings is described as a continuous flowing river where living beings can reach salvation under a certain buddha and thereby reach the further shore of nirvana and no longer be reborn derris adds that in the narratives about d\u012bpankara s prediction there is a shimmering temporal landscape in which the buddha to be sumedha is to some extent already the buddha words like jina lit conqueror and tath\u0101gatha are applied to him which are epithets of an already enlightened buddha this indicates how certain the prediction was seen to be post canonical p\u0101li works sanskrit works such as the mah\u0101vastu as well as sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and m\u016bla s\u0101rvastiv\u0101da commentaries describe that a buddha to be must go through several stages before becoming a buddha the natural stage before conceiving the wish to become a buddha the stage of taking a vow to become one and the stage of living in agreement with that vow fulfilling the perfections 72 at the fourth stage the buddha to be is declared to have an irreversible destination as a buddha 10 provided the buddha to be makes a correct vow among qualities needed for that vow to succeed the commentary of the j\u0101taka states that the buddha to be must fulfill eight conditions among which having extreme willpower and being male 75 these conditions are only found in the therav\u0101da texts buddhist studies scholar peter harvey does add though that the condition of being male only holds for becoming a buddha but not for becoming an enlightened disciple of a buddha in the p\u0101li tradition therefore this condition has hardly any practical consequences because buddhahood is seen as open for very few individuals and most people aim to attain enlightenment as a disciple instead most scholars agree that the p\u0101li canon does not describe the bodhisatta path as open for every individual and that the p\u0101li texts differ in this respect from mah\u0101y\u0101na buddhism in which the path of buddhahood is regarded as open for all a number of scholars have argued that there is no such difference however role in buddhism edit sumedha and d\u012bpankara buddha burmese manuscript british library in the therav\u0101da tradition the story is usually regarded as the beginning of the buddha s spiritual path and is included in the first part pali d\u016bre nid\u0101na lit distant epoch in most traditional accounts about the buddha s life the model for this organization of information was the buddhava\u1e43sa and the nid\u0101nakath\u0101 part of the commentary on the j\u0101takas in which the d\u016bre takes up half of the account 81 the story of sumedha attempts to establish a relation between gotama buddha and a lineage of predecessors thus legitimizing the message of the buddha and describing a pre enlightenment training this is comparable to how an indian king was anointed by his predecessor and therefore conforms to indian beliefs indeed the medieval p\u0101li j\u012bnala\u1e45k\u0101ra dubs d\u012bpankara s prophecy a great consecration consecration referring to anointment of kings pali mah\u0101bhiseka the story is the longest and most detailed account about a previous life of the buddha and serves as the model for other such accounts it is the oldest known buddhist story about the path of a bodhisatta and it forms the oldest instance in the p\u0101li tradition of the altruistic bodhisatta rationale depicting a person aiming for the enlightenment of other living beings indeed the story has been dubbed a concise therav\u0101din reformulation of the mah\u0101y\u0101na bodhisattva ideal as it deals with the very question of what it means to be a buddha to be the story defines the role of the bodhisatta path within therav\u0101din buddhist doctrine and terminology in a revolutionary manner using new terms like prediction pali vy\u0101kara\u1e47a aspiration pali abhin\u012bh\u0101ra and service meritorious act pali adhik\u0101ra the j\u0101takanid\u0101na describes the personal relationship between a buddha and a bodhisatta within the therav\u0101din doctrine and normalizes incorporates and integrates the bodhisatta in its structure scholar juyan zhang argues that accounts about sumedha in the ekottara \u0101gama and j\u0101taka nid\u0101na may have formed a prototype for the later mah\u0101y\u0101na mythology and iconography of the bodhisattva avalokite\u015bvara developing from the fifth century ce buddhist studies scholars hikata ryush\u014d and shizutani masao believe the story of sumedha to be part of primitive mah\u0101y\u0101na the earliest stage in the development of mah\u0101y\u0101na buddhism but archaeologist rhi juhyung believes the evidence is not yet definitive the story of sumedha s encounter with d\u012bpankara buddha is one of the most popular in buddhist art it is depicted in many therav\u0101din temples and is at least alluded to in a huge amount of religious works indeed in therav\u0101din buddhist culture the story of sumedha as well as hat of vessantara is as important as the final life of gotama buddha and in some countries sumedha s story is included in children s books about the buddha 90 the story of sumedha s encounter with d\u012bpankara has been much depicted in buddhist art in depictions of rebirth narratives in gandh\u0101ran art the story dominates and has an extraordinary position in the iconography of gandh\u0101ran monuments with relics st\u016bpas it is often depicted integrated with the present life of the buddha and is as at least as often depicted as key events in the buddha s last life the reason why the story was less influential outside of gandh\u0101ra may have been because vessantara s story was more popular there vessantara providing both a model in terms of spirituality and kingship the dharmarajika stupa in taxila pakistan buddhist studies scholar john s strong argues that some accounts of sumedha s life indicate a historical development toward a relic cult of bodhisattas in the texts of monastic discipline of the dharmaguptaka textual tradition sumedha receives the prediction of his future buddhahood and flies away into the air his hair however remains on the ground still spread out but now detached from his body d\u012bpankara warns his disciples not to step on the hair hundreds of thousands of persons then come and make offerings of flowers and perfumes to the hair in some versions of the story such as in the divyavad\u0101na st\u016bpas are built by local kings to enshrine the hairs buddhist studies scholar john s strong argues that these accounts indicate a historical development toward a relic cult of bodhisattas in modern times the story of sumedha s sacrifice has been raised by therav\u0101da buddhists as an example of selflessness in buddhism sri lankan monk and scholar walpola rahula wrote the bhikkhu buddhist monk is not a selfish cowardly individual thinking only of his happiness and salvation unmindful of whatever happens to the rest of humanity a true bhikkhu is an altruistic heroic person who considers others happiness more than his own he like the bodhisattva sumedha will renounce his own nirv\u0101\u1e47a for the sake of others buddhism is built upon service to others emphasis added on a similar note burmese politician aung san suu kyi raised sumedha s example as a model for selfless public service comparison with jainism edit d\u012bpankara and sumedha furfan china ninth eleventh century in jainism a similar story exists with regard to their founder mah\u0101vira who is predicted to become a jina an omniscient being in a future life he creates much bad karma however and is reborn in hell as a result later he manages to be reborn as a human being and fulfill the prophecy both the buddha to be and mah\u0101vira to be encounter 24 preceding omniscient teachers note 4 therefore there are similarities between this story on the one hand and the life of sumedha and his friend meghadatta on the other hand there are some differences however sumedha makes an aspiration for full enlightenment before he receives his prophecy whereas mar\u012bci the previous life of mah\u0101vira is not depicted as upholding such an aspiration and the prophecy is made at the request of mar\u012bci s father whereas in sumedha s case the prophecy is made in response to his aspiration secondly in mar\u012bci s case the prophecy also pertains to some worldly and morally dubious attainments such as becoming a powerful king pali cakkavatti sanskrit cakravartin whereas the prophecy sumedha receives does not contain such elements sumedha s aspiration is seen as a powerful and positive intention that can only lead to positive consequences as predicted in the prophecy in mar\u012bci s case however his prophecy is not connected with his conscious intention and the consequences of the prophecy are both positive and negative this ties in with doctrinal differences in karma and intention between the two religions whereas in buddhism intention is fundamental to the concept of karmic retribution in jainism all action is important even that without intention whereas in buddhism a positive and powerful aspiration is seen to only lead to positive results in jainism nearly all aspiration has a problematic side to it as mar\u012bci s

saint ursula and the 11 000 virgins 4 but was at first subordinate to that of her brother however the original dedication to alban at selje may not have been to the british saint but a german saint of the same name 5 rekdal 2004 draws further connections of the legend to early medieval norse gaelic contact especially to st donnan whose legend gives an account of the saint and his brothers being killed by pagans on the island of eigg in 617 sunniva s relics allegedly again found incorrupt were moved to the new cathedral in bergen in 1170 and as a result her veneration spread throughout norway during the fires in bergen of 1170 71 and of 1198 the relics of sunniva were taken from the cathedral and set down at sandbru this reportedly halted the advance of the fire and was hailed as a miracle the shrine with her relics remained in bergen s christ church until 1531 when the church was demolished in the turmoils of the reformation and the shrine was transferred to munkeliv monastery the shrine was lost when that monastery was destroyed in its turn in 1536 the feast day of alban and sunniva and their companions known as seljumannamesse is 8 july sunniva also has a separate feast day

softer fluffier texture and reduces the overall cooking time wrapping and steaming the suman in banana leaves imparts a distinct floral flavor that adds complexity steaming the cooked rice ensures the final rice cake has its proper sticky texture growing up in the philippines i was often woken from my siesta by the rhythmic chanting of street vendors whose voices echoed through the empty sweltering streets in the late afternoon this is how i knew it was time for merienda otherwise known as a meal in between meals or you know snack time i used to rush to our balcony craning my neck as if i were a giraffe to find the street peddler if they were close to our house i would chant back to them soon after i was rewarded with the privilege of choosing first from their warm steaming basket tucked inside was suman a steamed sticky rice cake mwasi a boiled rice patty topped with shredded coconut and muscovado sugar baye baye a mochi like cylindrical cake made with toasted young or glutinous rice grated coconuts and muscovado sugar and sometimes a version of a donut twist called bicho bicho it just depended on the day and the peddler s whims serious eats vicky wasik the suman i often got from the peddler which is the recipe i m sharing here is made from glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed it s then served hot with a generous sprinkle of muscovado sugar on top and or with a side of sweet ripe mango the banana leaf gives the suman a distinct tinge of green and imparts a floral scent to the rice cake in pre colonial philippines growing rice was labor intensive and rice was therefore largely reserved for deities leaders and socio religious rituals and gatherings like harvest ceremonies or honoring ancestors after the industrialization of agriculture the philippines produced more rice and the crop eventually became everyday fare to be enjoyed by all spinning off countless rice based dishes and snacks including a vast array of baked steamed and boiled rice based snacks called kakanin derived from two tagalog words kain to eat and kanin rice serious eats vicky wasik kakanin meanwhile can be further broken down into subcategories one of which is suman which is a type of rice cake that is usually wrapped in something there are many versions of suman which vary among regions and even from island to island and are distinguished by the kind of wrapper used or the methods employed to cook them you can change some of the ingredients the wrapper and the shape and still make something understood to be suman there s suman latik sticky rice cake served with coconut caramel and curds and suman sa lihiya which is made with lye on panay island where i was raised we have at least three different kinds of suman ibus eeh boos which is the same sticky rice cake but wrapped in buri palm leaves and boiled biko bee koh made with whole rice kernels not ground rice or rice flour and cooked with coconut milk and brown sugar then slathered with latik a coconut caramel sauce and baked unlike most suman biko is not wrapped in leaves but it s still understood by most to be a type of suman and alupi ah loo pee which is a grated cassava suman there s also a suman called moron or chocolate suman that s a mix of sticky rice and tablea native chocolate when i was developing this recipe it was important to me to perfect the sticky rice itself which is the primary component you can always jazz up the rice by adding other flavorings like ginger chocolate and grated coconut but the success of this suman sinks or swims with the rice serious eats vicky wasik the key to making a good suman is soaking the rice ahead of time to help fully hydrate the grains and cut down on your cooking time i ve definitely burned the bottom of a pot while making suman and that s something we want to avoid as you cook the rice it releases starch that will stick to the bottom and sometimes sides of the pot if not stirred constantly when the rice burns there s no saving it so make sure to mind and stir the rice at all times after the initial cooking of the rice it s spread out to cool then cut into portions and wrapped in the banana leaves which then get cooked again an essential two stage cooking process that gives the finished suman its signature sticky texture there are multiple ways to cook the assembled suman packets but the primary one is to steam them when setting up your steamer make sure you always have enough water at the bottom and check in between batches and refill as needed i recommend letting the water come to a boil first before you add the suman to steam so you ll have a more accurate cooking time than if you load the whole thing up and then wait for the steam to start if you re adding additional water to prevent the steamer from going dry make sure to get it up to boiling first so that you don t drop the temperature and cut the steam off midway through cooking serious eats vicky wasik once the suman is steamed give it a couple of minutes to cool down before opening the banana leaf wrapper but not long enough that it s gone cold it needs to have enough residual heat to slowly melt the topping of muscovado sugar and also to provide a contrast with the cool mango i almost always pair my suman with a cup of coffee to balance the sweet with a little bitter you can even add a scoop of ice cream and make it suman \u00e0 la mode beyond that feel free to treat this sticky rice cake as your blank canvas and let your imagination go wild"]}
