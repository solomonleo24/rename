layering here s what you need to know about each method to propagate jasmine from seed 1 watch your jasmine plant for seed pods typically toward the end of summer once these bean shaped pods begin to brown break them open and collect the seeds store in a warm dry place until you re ready to sow them 2 before sowing soak the seeds for 24 hours before planting them in a moist seed starting mix 3 cover the pots with clear plastic and place them in direct sunlight in a warm location keep the soil evenly moist at all times to propagate jasmine from cuttings 1 in the fall take a 4 to 6 inch cutting remove any spent blooms and the lower leaves leaving at least three upper leaves on the cutting 2 dip the end of the cutting in rooting hormone and plant in damp potting soil 3 place a large clear plastic bag over the pot and put it in bright indirect light the cutting should root in about four to six weeks to propagate jasmine by layering 1 layering is a mostly hands off process that works well with jasmine in spring or early summer while leaving a stem attached to the plant bend it down to the soil near the plant or in a pot next to the plant 2 push a section of the stem with leaves into the soil leaving the stem tip above soil level press down on the soil to firm it 3 in time the buried section of the stem will develop roots and can be removed from the parent plant and transplanted jasmine has its peak scent at night for tea thousands of jasmine blossoms are layered between alternating layers of tea leaves at night after four hours the tea will absorb the scent to flavor the tea in some cases this process is repeated several times for a more intense flavor types of jasmine the biggest difference between jasmine varieties is their growth habit the most well

pruning is best done after flowering always use clean sharp pruners prune trellised vines all the way back to the support shrubs can be pruned back by up to two thirds of the plant damaged or diseased branches can be removed anytime propagating jasmine jasmine is propagated using several methods but taking cuttings is the easiest method for home gardeners this is done in spring and early summer when new green growth is present on the plant take several cuttings to increase chances for success gather a sterile cutting tool pot light potting mix rooting hormone and plastic covering and follow these steps choose a healthy jasmine plant and take new growth stem cuttings six to eight inches long and remove all but the top two or three sets of leaves fill a pot with moistened planting medium optionally apply rooting hormone to the cut ends of the cuttings plant the cuttings into the pot cover with plastic and place in a location to receive bright indirect light and keep potting mix evenly moist be patient root development may take four to six weeks check by gently tugging on the cutting resistance indicates roots have formed allow new plants to develop to three to four inches tall before potting up into permanent containers or moving into the garden potting and repotting jasmine jasmine plants produce prolific blooms when slightly root bound however if the roots of your plant are growing through drainage holes in the pot it s time to transfer it into a container one to two inches larger on average repotting is necessary about every three years and is done in early spring before new growth begins when potting a new nursery plant choose a container three times the size of its current pot choose a container with good drainage and one large enough to accommodate support for vining varieties a pot with some weight to it such as ceramic or clay helps balance plants that become top heavy add bark and moss to the planting mix to help lighten potting soil and increase nutrient uptake choose a potting mix with perlite or vermiculite to ensure adequate drainage common pests plant diseases ornamentals with highly fragrant flowers like jasmine are attractive to a number of pests and vulnerable to several fungal infections pests garden grown jasmine is vulnerable to leaf chewing caterpillars including budworms leaf rollers and webworms budworms are the larval form of a small white moth that eats flower buds a curled leaf indicates the presence of leaf rollers and webworms build spidery web type nets be sure to apply horticultural oil at the first sign of pests houseplants are more likely to attract sap sucking insects including aphids spider mites whiteflies scale and thrips although these pests can also damage outdoor plants these are mostly tiny insects and are difficult to spot yellowing wilted or spotted leaves and webbing are signs pests are present try applying insecticidal soap in cases of severe infestation a targeted pesticide may be required diseases fusarium wilt is a soil borne fungus difficult to eradicate roots of affected plants turn black and succumb to rot and in most cases plants must be disposed of try repeated applications of targeted fungicide or if caught early try moving the plant to a new location remove damaged roots and treat remaining roots before replanting fusarium wilt usually appears during warm temperatures rust appears as red discoloration on all parts of the plant copper based fungicides may control this infection brownish circular spots on the leaves s upper surfaces indicate a leaf blight fungus leaves may curl and start to dry up blight is most likely to occur in wet conditions treat with a targeted fungicide how to get jasmine to bloom jasmine blooms profusely and reliably as long as long as plants are kept warm evenly moist and given enough bright sun exposure bloom months different jasmine species bloom at different times of year according to their usda growing zones for example pink jasmine is strictly a late winter early spring bloomer while royal jasmine can flower almost all year long in its hardiness zone how long does jasmine bloom bloom periods vary according to species and may be as brief as one or two months other species grown in warmer hardiness zones may produce flowers repeatedly all year what to jasmine flowers look and smell like flowers may be single or double with single blooms usually tubular and star shaped with five petals they appear singly or in clusters of three blooms that each have four to nine petals colors include shades of yellow white and pinkish white flowers are generally small about one inch across but numerous the scent of jasmine flowers is valued in aromatherapy and the perfume trade fragrance is light but complex described as rich sweet and fruity with a slight muskiness how to encourage more blooms work compost into soil annually for garden grown plants or fertilize in early spring with a slow release granular formula and apply mulch fertilize container grown plants and houseplants every two weeks during the growing seasons with a half dilution of a quality plant food or formula with a greater amount of phosphorous alternatively slow release granular fertilizer can be raked into the top one to two inches of potting medium caring for jasmine after it blooms hard pruning after bloom keeps jasmine plants compact and manageable and encourages more blooms the following season for houseplants eliminate feeding and reduce watering frequency after bloom during the off season deadheading jasmine flowers use a sharp scissor or hand pruner to remove flowers when they start to fade cut flower stems as close to the main stem as possible but avoid damage to foliage deadheading encourages more flowers and keeps leaves and stems healthy and green"

the hive were using to drain power from the traveler using a piece of the traveler which the guardian frees allowing it to return to the traveler and destroying a powerful weapon called the sword of crota c and severing their long distance communications around this time the guardian is contacted by the exo stranger a mysterious woman who summons them to venus to face a new enemy the vex when the guardian arrives on venus the exo stranger describes the vex as an evil so dark it despises other evil she tells them about the black garden a city where the vex are born and implores the guardian to find it and rip out its heart as it is the only way the traveler will begin to heal ghost says that they need to speak to the awoken who lurk out in the reef the asteroid belt and refuse to take sides in the galaxy s wars the exo stranger then leaves as she did not have time to explain things further once the guardian arrives at the reef they meet the queen of the reef mara sov and her brother prince uldren sov who tells the guardian that they will help them locate the black garden if they bring them the head of a vex gate lord the guardian travels back to venus where they uncover the archive which reveals secrets about the vex including the location of a place called the vault of glass and pathways across the galaxy after defeating draksis a fallen kell of the house of winter d the guardian confronts the vex gate lord claims its head and returns to the queen who tells them to take its eye to the meridian bay on mars where it can be used to enter the black garden after arriving on mars in the meridian bay ghost informs the guardian of its inhabitants the cabal have been trying to break the encryption on the vex gate with only limited success but they do control many of the places that the guardian needs to visit on mars thanks to their exclusion zone which nobody had ever penetrated the player s guardian becomes the first to penetrate the exclusion zone and heads to the garden s spire which charges the gate lord s eye they also travel to the buried city the birthplace of many technological wonders where they discover an ai that used to be linked to the warmind

healing at the tower the speaker addresses gathered guardians in a celebratory speech over in the nearby hangar though the player s guardian converses with the exo stranger who says that the fight is far from over the heart of the black garden may have been destroyed but on venus the vault of glass suddenly reopens a team of guardians decide to investigate the mysterious vault of glass vault of glass raid described as the vex underworld by the ishtar collective the vault is a realm where the vex can control reality and even erase people from existence this power is used by the most powerful denizens within the vault a vex sub race called the gorgons a powerful vex mind called the templar and atheon time s conflux both atheon and the templar utilize machines called oracles to do so while these powers do not extend to outside the vault its enigmatic nature has lured countless guardians to their doom the most infamous being the ill fated fireteam of kabr the legionless which consisted of himself future war cult warlock praedyth and well known hunter pahanin pahanin was the only member to make it out alive praedyth was forever lost in the dark corners of time and kabr drank the radiolaria of the oracles and was turned into a vex however in kabr s last moments he used his light to close the vault and leave behind an artifact the aegis to help any other guardians daring enough to follow in his footsteps the new fireteam of guardians make their descent and attempt to succeed where kabr and his fireteam failed using the aegis the guardians manage to defeat the templar and its oracles they then successfully traverse the gorgon s labyrinth undetected before finally reaching atheon time s conflux a central figure of the vex conflux network atheon is able to send guardians into the distant past or future at will and summons versions of vex from the past and future to aid him the vex mind is also capable of summoning oracles like the templar and attempts to erase the new fireteam from existence however despite the astronomical odds the guardians fight their way through time destroy the oracles and defeat atheon eliminating a major vex threat development edit bungie had announced in 2007 it was becoming an independent studio and separating from microsoft game studios though contractually remained committed to completing halo reach as bungie tied up development of reach in 2010 it began developing its next new intellectual property ip destiny under the code name project tiger 40 41 the company recognized it would need a major publisher to support their project according to martin o donnell they had considered going back to microsoft and also had approached sony interactive entertainment as a publishing partner but both companies would have required bungie to turn over control of the ip which bungie considered was non negotiable activision blizzard on the other hand would allow bungie to retain control on the ip with expectations of financial performance over the years 42 bungie s 10 year publishing agreement with activision blizzard was announced by april 2010 43 44 under bungie s agreement with activision new ip developed by bungie will be owned by bungie not activision in a deal similar to the ea partners program 44 45 details of this contract were revealed during the course of activision s lawsuit against jason west and vincent zampella founders and former employees of infinity ward including provisions for four destiny games over the course of the ten year deal 46 47 48 initially activision blizzard ceo robert kotick suggested that the total investment in destiny would be around 500 million bungie s coo pete parsons clarified that the game s development cost is not even close to 500 million saying for marketing you d have to ask activision people but for development costs not anything close to 500 million 49 activision subsequently confirmed the 500 million figure stating that marketing up front infrastructure costs and investment in the game s engine were included and could be amortized over the life of the ip 50 bungie would earn an additional 2 5 million bonus payout if the first game achieved a metacritic score of 90 or above 40 51 by mid 2013 most of the ground work for destiny had been completed including lore game engine and many environments and missions tracking for a september 2013 release 40 52 however a supercut of the game s story and mission structure presented by joseph staten s writing team did not test well with bungie upper management led by jason jones 40 jones felt that the story was too dense and linear a design philosophy he felt was important to destiny was the ability for the player to choose where to go at any time 40 as a result the entire mission progression of the game was rebuilt between mid 2013 and the game s launch in september 2014 shifting away from a structure that quickly introduced the four major environments earth the moon venus and mars to a hub based structure in which each planet would be visited sequentially with an expanding variety of missions on each 40 existing missions were spliced and rearranged to fit this new paradigm including dialogue and cinematics staten decided to leave the company amidst this reboot though this would not be announced until september 2013 53 to cement the new framework jones developed the director interface that exists in the shipping version of the game from which planets and missions can be selected 40 he also established the iron bar a series of executive meetings which would oversee the massive project restructuring this also involved rescoping the project to be more focused areas such as the hive fortress dreadnaught an earth location called the european dead zone and osiris temple on mercury were cut all would later return in future installments the restructuring also required an internal delay of the release date first from september 2013 to march 2014 and again to its actual release of september 9 2014 40 52 with staten s departure the writing team he had built at bungie for the halo series was left leaderless and isolated as a result much of this extra time was spent perfecting the gameplay and feel of the shooting while the narrative was only polished to a perfunctory level and the story was written without writers 40 on april 11 2014 bungie fired its long time composer and audio director martin o donnell 54 for destiny o donnell collaborated with paul mccartney on an eight movement symphonic suite called music of the spheres which was completed in 2013 55 the dispute which led to his termination originated from o donnell s belief that the activision deal had begun to erode the collegial culture at bungie activision was reluctant to release the symphony as a standalone work and went over o donnell s head to replace it with their own music in a prominent e3 2013 trailer 55 in the ensuing disagreement o donnell came into conflict with both activision and bungie leadership and was accused of unacceptable conduct in his performance review leading to his termination 55 fans were concerned that the absence of martin o donnell would affect the in game music of destiny however pete parsons of bungie confirmed that destiny s music was already complete by this point 56 o donnell prevailed in a civil suit against bungie over the improper dismissal in september 2015 winning unpaid wages profit sharing and lost stock 55 57 however bungie later filed a complaint against o donnell in 2021 after o donnell had uploaded his work from music of the spheres and destiny to his youtube and bandcamp channels which bungie stated was against the terms placed against o donnell as a result of an injunction raised in the 2015 trial who had been ordered to return all this work to bungie o donnell was found in contempt of court in september 2021 for violating that injunction and ordered to remove the material as well as submit to review of all his electronic media for any further copies of destiny related materials 58 technology edit destiny incorporates a new game engine called the tiger engine that is based on the engine used for most halo games 59 it allows global illumination and real time dynamic lighting to occur together in cohesion 60 in addition bungie s goal is that destiny will natively render graphics at 1080p on both the xbox one and playstation 4 61 an innovation in bungie s hopper technology which has been the backbone for halo s matchmaking system will allow better player matchmaking in order to create a more natural experience in either cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes 62 developers at bungie have criticized the new engine as ill suited to the online nature of the game its resource intensive nature makes even small changes to maps require an overnight rendering and compiling process 40 internal sources called the development of new maps and missions grueling on account of the game engine 40 design edit left but was replaced with right starting with the taken king the player s companion ghost was initially voiced by peter dinklage but was replaced with nolan north starting with for destiny lead writer joseph staten hoped to build a universe that would take on a life of its own 63 the designers worked around seven pillars seven core principles which ensure that the game is accessible to both casual novice players and experienced veterans of first person shooters and mmos 29 30 64 this includes integration with social media allowing players to gain information about new quests and their friends activities 29 in designing the playable classes bungie was inspired by different sources of science fiction hunters are a reconnaissance class meant to be reminiscent of the classic bounty hunter bungie cites as influences star wars han solo and classic characters from old western films such as clint eastwood s man with no name warlocks combine weapons with special powers from the traveler and are meant to be a form of space wizard the warlock class is influenced by the star wars series s jedi knights the lord of the rings series s gandalf and the matrix series s morpheus titans which favor heavy weapons and melee attacks and are intended to be reminiscent of the classic future soldier were inspired by bungie s own master chief from halo stormtroopers from star wars and other space marines from science fiction 65 bungie also cited the influence of action role playing games monster hunter and dark souls noting their mechanical depth and brutality 66 peter dinklage originally voiced the character ghost in the base game the character did not have any lines in the two expansions of year one nolan north replaced dinklage for the taken king and also re recorded all of ghost s lines from the original game as bungie wanted to create a consistent storytelling experience from beginning to end north was excited to put his mark on the role and hopes to evolve the character in future destiny releases he said that he did not listen to any of dinklage s recordings as he did not want any preconceived notions to influence his performance 36 according to bungie the actor change was made due to dinklage s availability 67 david cross was hired to write jokes for the character ghost but none of his work was used in the final game 68 soundtrack edit destiny original soundtrack edit destiny original soundtrack is the official soundtrack for the video game composed by michael salvatori c paul johnson martin o donnell and paul mccartney released digitally via itunes on september 26 2014 the soundtrack contains 44 instrumental compositions from the game 69 70 the soundtrack marked o donnell s final work for bungie after years of composing for the halo franchise as well as several games before that in addition mccartney wrote and recorded an original song inspired by the game titled hope for the future 69 71 72 early in destiny s development o donnell was contacted by pete parsons current chief operating officer of bungie and was asked to begin writing music for the game at the time destiny was still in its infancy as it lacked any gameplay material for o donnell to score music to so instead o donnell began creating music based solely on the game s ideas stories and artwork 73 by february 17 2013 over 50 minutes of the soundtrack had already been recorded with a 106 piece orchestra at abbey road studios in london 74 o donnell gave the early pieces of music to bungie in hopes that they would foster inspiration within the development team 75 unlike the halo series where pieces of music were only 2 3 minutes long o donnell has stated that the soundtrack for destiny has no time restrictions with the pieces clocking in as long as they need to be 74 o donnell collaborated with paul mccartney on the soundtrack for the better part of two years as they traded ideas melody samples and themes back and forth 76 on april 11 2014 martin o donnell was dismissed without cause by the board of directors at bungie 77 this caused concern as to whether this would affect the game however pete parsons stated that o donnell s work on the game had been completed before his dismissal and would appear in the final product 78 music of the spheres edit music of the spheres is an eight part musical companion piece to destiny composed by marty o donnell together with michael salvatori and paul mccartney parts of the music were used to accompany a destiny trailer at e3 2013 and in the official soundtrack but following o donnell s dismissal from and subsequent legal dispute with bungie music of the spheres remained unreleased it was leaked to the internet by unknown persons in december 2017 79 bungie officially released the album on june 1 2018 80 release edit destiny concept art and plot elements first leaked in november 2012 81 bungie supplemented the leak with more details expressing

upon release aggregating review website metacritic gave the xbox one version 75 100 based on 11 reviews 154 and the playstation 4 version 76 100 based on 95 reviews 153 bungie halted pre release reviews stating that they felt the game should be graded only when its social aspects were operative and populated with thousands of gamers in order to give a proper assessment 168 gamespot described the game as a multiplayer shooter that cobbles together elements of massively multiplayer games but overlooks the lessons developers of such games learned many years ago however the game s competitive multiplayer modes were praised for carrying on bungie s expertise from the halo franchise with well designed maps 160 tom watson admitted in new statesman that it has taken over my life he praised how the game plundered the best bits of other successful franchises such as halo call of duty wolfenstein the new order and world of warcraft 169 danny o dwyer stated that destiny s development surfaces some troubling ethical questions about the role of design in video game addiction comparing it to slot machines and lab pigeons in variable reward experiments i m not saying it s a bad game i m saying it s a manipulative one i mean it s farmville for shooter fans instead of farming for land you re farming for xp loot and whatever fake new currency the game creates to keep you inside another masterfully crafted ratio scheduling system 170 the verge criticized the game s reliance on collaboration with other players that demands at least a few hours each week in order to keep up with character power levels with a player s friends or being forced to play with strangers to complete the story content 171 gametrailers gave a generally positive review but also criticized the weak story and uninspired game locations however they did praise the graphics as well as the rush the combat can provide the player 161 a general lack of cohesive communication between players was also criticized with game informer calling it downplayed and difficult 172 eurogamer felt that the game s environments were meticulously built with plenty of enticing nooks and thoughtfully placed cover to support that thrilling combat but that patrol mode exposed the worlds as being more like giant shooter levels connected by narrow passageways than a truly expansive open world 157 destiny was criticized for its lack of story content with many pointing to the disjointed narrative and shallow plot implementation bungie has since acknowledged that the story was lacking in some respects and stated that the game s first dlc expansion the dark below would focus on providing more background to the universe of destiny 173 the game s end game content was the subject of criticism due to its particular focus on grinding for rare items through various means including multiplayer games and other missions 174 the discovery of loot caves locations with quickly re spawning enemies that could previously be used to farm for items along with initial issues surrounding the vault of glass raid mission became associated with these lingering issues 175 176 177 178 despite the criticism the game received the title of game of the year from gamesradar 179 the bafta award for best game at the british academy video games awards 180 at the 2014 national academy of video game trade reviewers navgtr

of the twelve progenitors of the tribes of israel rachel s father was laban her older sister was leah jacob s first wife her aunt rebecca was jacob s mother 2 marriage to jacob edit rachel and jacob at the well by james tissot c 1896 1902 rachel is first mentioned in the hebrew bible in genesis 29 when jacob happens upon her as she is about to water her father s flock she was the second daughter of laban rebekah s brother making jacob her first cousin 2 jacob had traveled a great distance to find laban rebekah had sent him there to be safe from his angry twin brother esau during jacob s stay he fell in love with rachel and agreed to work seven years for laban in return for her hand in marriage on the night of the wedding the bride was veiled and jacob did not notice that leah rachel s older sister had been substituted for rachel whereas rachel was lovely in form and beautiful leah had tender eyes a later jacob confronted laban who excused his own deception by insisting that the older sister should marry first he assured jacob that after his wedding week was finished he could take rachel as a wife as well and work another seven years as payment for her when god saw that leah was unloved he opened her womb genesis 29 31 4 and she gave birth to four sons rachel like sarah and rebekah remained unable to conceive according to biblical scholar tikva frymer kensky the infertility of the matriarchs has two effects it heightens the drama of the birth of the eventual son marking isaac jacob and joseph as special and it emphasizes that pregnancy is an act of god 5 rachel became jealous of leah and gave jacob her maidservant bilhah to be a surrogate mother for her bilhah gave birth to two sons that rachel named and raised dan and naphtali leah responded by offering her handmaid zilpah to jacob and named and raised the two sons gad and asher that zilpah bore according to some commentaries bilhah and zilpah were half sisters of leah and rachel 6 after leah conceived again rachel finally had a son joseph 2 who would become jacob s favorite child children edit rachel s son joseph was destined to be the leader of israel s tribes between exile and nationhood this role is exemplified in the biblical story of joseph who prepared the way in egypt for his family s exile there 7 after joseph s birth jacob decided to return to the land of canaan with his family 2 fearing that laban would deter him he fled with his two wives leah and rachel and twelve children without informing his father in law laban pursued him and accused him of stealing his teraphim indeed rachel had taken her father s teraphim hidden them inside her camel s seat cushion and sat upon them laban had neglected to give his daughters their inheritance genesis 31 14 16 5 not knowing that the teraphim were in his wife s possession jacob pronounced a curse on whoever had them with whoever you will find your gods he will not live genesis 31 32 laban proceeded to search the

middle of the birth that her child was a boy 8 before she died rachel named her son ben oni son of my mourning but jacob called him ben yamin benjamin rashi explains that ben yamin either means son of the right i e south since benjamin was the only one of jacob s sons born in canaan which is to the south of paddan aram or it could mean son of my days as benjamin was born in jacob s old age burial edit biblical scholarship distinguishes between two narratives for the site of rachel s burial a northern one suggesting a site north of jerusalem near ramah modern al ram and a southern one placing it close to bethlehem rachel was buried on the road to ephrath just outside bethlehem 9 and not in the ancestral tomb at machpelah where her husband jacob and her sister leah were buried rachel s tomb

trains along the route 2 this included named freight trains such as the alaga and the pioneer 5 in 1944 the seaboard air line acquired the georgia florida and alabama railway which ran from richland

most populous city and the prime objective of general william t sherman s march to the sea on december 21 1864 local authorities negotiated a peaceful surrender to save savannah from destruction and union troops marched into the city at dawn 13 savannah was named after the savannah river which probably derives from variant names for the shawnee a native american people who migrated to the river in the 1680s the shawnee destroyed another native people the westo and occupied their lands at the head of the savannah river s navigation on the fall line near present day augusta 14 these shawnee whose native name was \u0161a wano ki literally southerners 15 were known by several local variants including shawano savano savana and savannah 16 another theory is that the name savannah refers to the extensive marshlands surrounding the river for miles inland and is derived from the english term savanna a kind of tropical grassland which was borrowed by the english from spanish sabana and used in the southern colonies the spanish word comes from the taino word zabana 17 still other theories suggest that the name savannah originates from algonquian terms meaning not only southerners but perhaps also salt 18 19 geography edit savannah lies on the savannah river approximately 20 mi 32 km upriver from the atlantic ocean 20 according to the united states census bureau 2011 the city has a

        "allison transmission holdings inc is an american manufacturer of commercial duty automatic transmissions and hybrid propulsion systems allison products are specified by over 250 vehicle manufacturers and are used in many market sectors including bus refuse fire construction distribution military and specialty applications racing team edit allison began in 1909 when james a allison along with three business partners helped fund and build the indianapolis motor speedway in 1911 allison s new track held the first indianapolis 500 mile race in addition to funding several race teams james allison founded the speedway racing team company on september 14 1915 3 and quickly gained a reputation for his work on race cars and automotive technology in general 4 allison built a shop near the track and changed the team s name to the allison experimental company the shop later became plant no 1 3 wartime aviation edit when world war i began allison suspended racing and the allison experimental company began machining parts tools and masters for the liberty airplane engine the main power plant used in the u s war effort after the war allison entered a car in the 1919 indy 500 and won it was the last race allison s team ever entered as he turned his company s attention to aviation engineering renaming it to allison engineering company the aviation focused company developed steel backed bronze sleeve bearings for the crankshaft and connecting rods and high speed reduction gearing to turn propellers and roots type blowers 3 the company s reputation and expertise in aviation was the major factor in general motors decision to buy the company following james allison s death in 1928 5 6 shortly after the sale to general motors on april 1 1929 allison engineers began work on a 12 cylinder engine to replace the aging liberty engines the result was the v1710 12 cylinder aircraft engine and it made the company renamed to the allison division of gm in 1934 3 also known as the allison engine company a major force in aviation 7 plant 3 was built in 1939 a 360 000 sq ft 33 000 m2 factory to build v1710 engines due to demand during world war ii allison would add a second factory plant 5 and 23 000 new employees by the end of the war allison had built 70 000 v1710 engines 3 early transmission development edit alongside the development and production of the v1710 engineers at gm began designing the cd 850 cross drive steering transmission for tracked military vehicles in 1941 the design was completed in 1944 and allison was awarded the contract to manufacture the prototypes in february 1945 general motors formed the allison transmission engineering section dividing the subsidiary into aircraft operations and transmission operations in 1946 3 the cd 850 combined range change steering and braking 8 9 allison stopped producing the cd 850 in 1986 but a licensed version was produced in spain for more than a decade afterward 3 general motors began developing automatic transmissions with a hydraulic torque converter in the 1930s under its product study group offering it as an option for oldsmobile for the first time in 1940 3 after world war ii allison transmission turned its attention to civilian transportation allison designed developed and manufactured the first ever automatic transmissions for heavy duty vehicles including delivery trucks city buses and railcars starting from 1948 8 9 in addition allison marketed transmissions for off highway heavy duty vehicles under the brand powershift torqmatic with the first tg series transmissions being produced in july 1948 10 the allison 850 series torque converter was a crucial component in the post war development of self propelled railcars most notably the budd rail diesel car which first went into service in 1950 11 pairing with a gm series 110 pancake diesel engine mounted under the railcar floor enabled the entire power system to be kept outside the car body making the full length of the car available for revenue the torque converter enabled unprecedented rates of acceleration before locking into direct drive 12 at approximately the same time the cd 850 was going into production gmc truck and coach division requested that gm develop a v drive transmission with a torque converter in 1945 for transit bus use replacing the spicer manual transmission then offered 3 these buses had rear mounted engines and to maximize passenger space the engine compartment was minimized the v drive transmission was named for the 63 angle of intersection between the transmission shaft input from the engine and output to the rear axle 3 development of the v drive transmission was led by bob schaefer an emigrant from germany who had joined gm in 1942 after helping to lead the twin disc company which was one of the licensees of the ljungstroms hydraulic torque converter schaefer was reassigned from the detroit transmission division to allison in 1946 3 the first production v drive transmissions were delivered in october 1947 with the first major contract being for 900 buses in 1948 for new york city 3 the vs 2 was introduced in 1955 which added a two speed input splitter a version with both hydraulic and direct clutches was introduced in 1958 vh and production of the original v drive transmissions was concluded in july 1976 with 65 389 produced 3 commercial transmissions edit in addition to the transit bus market allison began developing automatic transmissions for commercial trucks in 1953 this effort resulted in the mt 25 which designated the intended application m edium t rucks and maximum input power 250 hp 190 kw the mt 25 was a 6 speed automatic using a two speed high low splitter and three speed double planetary gear train the splitter was equipped with a hydraulic retarder 3 because of the additional cost of the automatic transmission sales were initially slow until allison began targeting specific markets that required both on and off road driving as well as frequent stops and starts such as concrete mixing and garbage trucks in the early 1960s 3 the mt 25 was fitted first as an option branded powermatic by powermatic 13 14 exclusive to that brand for the first year but was soon offered by other truck manufacturers including ford 1957 reo 1958 dodge 1958 diamond t 1959 white 1961 and international harvester 1961 production of the mt 25 continued into the early 1970s 3 the mt 25 was supplemented in september 1970 by a second generation lighter duty automatic transmission the four speed at 540 15 which allison developed jointly with hydramatic division in the late 1960s the at 540 was targeted specifically for on highway use and shared similarities with automobile transmissions to reduce the cost penalty to equip on highway trucks with automatic transmissions 3 later the mt 25 itself was replaced by the mt 640 and a heavier duty version the ht 740 was introduced the new mt and ht were both derived from the at 540 as an option the mt 6nn and ht 7nn series transmissions could be equipped with a lower fifth gear for severe off road conditions 3 in 1970 gm combined the allison and detroit diesel divisions as the detroit diesel allison division of gm 3 the 500 series transmissions at 540 etc were rated to accept input power of up to 235 hp 175 kw and were intended for vehicles up to 30 000 lb 14 000 kg gross vehicle weight gvw the medium duty 600 series had increased ratings to 300 hp 220 kw and 73 280 lb 33 240 kg gvw while the heavy duty 700 series were rated to 445 hp 332 kw and 80 000 lb 36 000 kg gvw 3 in 1976 a 700 series v drive transmission was introduced for buses the v730 3 the at mt ht were still being produced in 1998 3 allison also produced off highway transmissions in the 1960s starting with the dual path powershift dp 8000 series 16 the first electronic controls were fitted to the off highway dp 8000 series transmission in 1971 17 electronic controls branded the allison transmission electronic control or atec system were added to the mt ht v730 in 1983 improving fuel economy by more precisely controlling shifts 3 world transmission edit cutaway view of 3rd gen wt md3060 the third generation six speed world transmission wt was introduced in 1991 replacing the second generation at mt ht v730 lines development of the wt had begun in the mid 1980s prior to the sale of detroit diesel to roger penske in 1987 the wt used the wt electronic control wtec system to control the internal clutches during shifting equipped with a control unit that adapts to variations during use 3 the wt line was split into md medium duty hd heavy duty introduced in 1993 18 and b t drive buses lines 3 the md and hd lines were later renamed to the 3000 and 4000 series respectively as of 1998 in the united states allison had built 92 of the transmissions in school buses 75 of transit bus transmissions 65 of heavy duty garbage truck transmissions and 32 of all medium duty truck transmissions 3 allison followed the wt 3000 and 4000 series line with the 1000 and 2000 series starting in 1999 3 the 1000 series transmission incorporated many features from the wt line for light duty trucks including the electronic control system and was initially available as an option with the 6 6l gm isuzu duramax diesel engine and the 8 1l vortec gasoline engine for the trucks based on the gmt800 platform 19 20 in 2007 gm sold allison transmission to private equity firms carlyle group and onex corporation for us 5 6 billion 21",

edit daniella alonso portrays anna taggaro a bisexual character portrayed by daniella alonso anna taggaro appeared in eleven episodes of season 2 the character is credited by afterellen com as the first recurring bisexual character of color on television though whether the character is truly bisexual or simply gay is debated by fans 37 anna moves to tree hill to escape rumors that she has been having a relationship with another girl 18 she is first introduced in season 2 i will dare when she helps lucas escape the security guards at the local mall the two then go to a pizzeria together 38 she and lucas watch a meteor shower which her brother felix disapproves of 13 they decide to take things slow becoming friends with potential 14 however she offers him sex after a formal dance which he turns down due to not being in love with her 16 lucas ends the relationship after realizing that he has feelings for brooke 17 however the two remain friends as she confides her sexuality to him anna forms a strong relationship with peyton and kisses her after misreading the signs 18 when she discovers that felix wrote dyke on peyton s locker she turns him in getting him expelled she comes out to him and states how hurt she is by his use of the word 28 anna decides that she should stop running from who she is and comes out to her parents and eventually leaves tree hill to re join her previous school 29 her use of the word gay instead of bisexual wasn t meant to imply that anna is not bisexual if i had known the word bisexual was more taboo we may have gone in that direction for me it seemed like felix was so homophobic that for her to say i m gay to him felt even stronger for her mark schwahn on the decision for the character to come out using the word gay 37 when creating characters for season 2 schwahn had wanted to add a family which the addition of anna and felix allowed him to do while casting daniella alonso he refrained from telling her that the rumors regarding anna s sexuality were true however once he informed her of her character s back story it was like flipping a switch for alonso as she knew what to play 23 the character was made bisexual as opposed to a lesbian so that her past could be kept secret anna was presented as a romantic interest for lucas schwahn thought if she was strictly a lesbian character that would be really out of nature for her and a little disingenuous to lesbians and they needed to hide what her journey was going to be 37 alonso feels that the audience was not receptive to the character initially especially with a large portion of the audience wanting brooke and lucas to be together however over the course of her arc they began to accept anna 23 emily chambers edit emily chambers who pretended to be jules was

of 100 on metacritic based on 24 reviews 49 anne t donahue of the guardian stated that coven could be american horror story s best instalment yet writing that s not to say coven is perfect it s been called out as glorified slave torture porn in the us and it s important that madame lelaurie s storyline comes full circle and that slavery is handled in a responsible way the same goes for zoe s storyline and the incidences of sexual assault within this season too but american horror story can handle it and while it s obviously over the top its broader social commentary makes it a unique series unlike anything we ve seen on television before it s a conventional horror story but it s america s horror story too just try making it through an episode without hiding behind the sofa 50 in

coven were wickedly amusing next year i hope american horror story can be more than that and with less 52 in contrast coven was also met with negative reviews from some critics the a v club gave the season a low rating of d with critic emily vanderwerff remarking it lurched drunkenly from idea to idea never settling on one long enough to build anything of worth 53 some critics like amanda kay leblanc state that the series is ineffective in completely opposing the ideas of racism oppression and racial conflict that are integral to coven s conception 54 although the narrative of coven explicitly decries racism she writes it simultaneously invests in colorblind racist narratives whiteness is central in coven operating through discourse that ignores racial difference and contemporary forms of oppression and erasure 55 she additionally argues that coven excessively depends on and uses the imagery of violence against black people for entertainment and plot progression 55 american

        "table of contents ask the chatbot trinity in christian doctrine the unity of father son and holy spirit as three persons in one godhead the doctrine of the trinity is considered to be one of the central christian affirmations about god it is rooted in the fact that god came to meet christians in a threefold figure 1 as creator lord of the history of salvation father and judge as revealed in the old testament 2 as the lord who in the incarnated figure of jesus christ lived among human beings and was present in their midst as the resurrected one and 3 as the holy spirit whom they experienced as the helper or intercessor in the power of the new life trinity the trinity tempera and gold on parchment by taddeo crivelli from a manuscript from 1460 70 in the j paul getty museum los angeles god the father holds the crucified christ with the dove as the holy spirit between the two more neither the word trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the new testament nor did jesus and his followers intend to contradict the shema in the hebrew scriptures hear o israel the lord our god is one lord deuteronomy 6 4 the earliest christians however had to cope with the implications of the coming of jesus christ and of the presumed presence and power of god among them i e the holy spirit whose coming was connected with the celebration of pentecost the father son and holy spirit were associated in such new testament passages as the great commission go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit matthew 28 19 and in the apostolic benediction the grace of the lord jesus christ the love of god and the communion of the holy spirit be with you all 2 corinthians 13 13 thus the new testament established the basis for the doctrine of the trinity the doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies initially both the requirements of monotheism inherited from the hebrew scriptures and the implications of the need to interpret the biblical teaching to greco roman religions seemed to demand that the divine in christ as the word or logos be interpreted as subordinate to the supreme being an alternative solution was to interpret father son and holy spirit as three modes of the self disclosure of the one god but not as distinct within the being of god itself the first tendency recognized the distinctness among the three but at the cost of their equality and hence of their unity subordinationism the second came to terms with their unity but at the cost of their distinctness as persons modalism the high point of these conflicts was the so called arian controversy in the early 4th century in his interpretation of the idea of god arius sought to maintain a formal understanding of the oneness of god in defense of that oneness he was obliged to dispute the sameness of essence of the son and the holy spirit with god the father it was not until later in the 4th century that the distinctness of the three and their unity were brought together in a single orthodox doctrine of one essence and three persons britannica quiz christianity quiz the council of nicaea in 325 stated the crucial formula for that doctrine in its confession that the son is of the same substance homoousios as the father even though it said very little about the holy spirit over the next half century st athanasius defended and refined the nicene formula and by the end of the 4th century under the leadership of st basil of caesarea st gregory of nyssa and st gregory of nazianzus the cappadocian fathers the doctrine of the trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since it is accepted in all of the historic confessions of christianity even though the impact of the enlightenment decreased its importance in some traditions",
        "what does the trinity mean in christianity definition and core concept the trinity in christianity is the doctrine that the one god eternally exists as three distinct persons the father the son jesus christ and the holy spirit these three share the same divine essence yet remain one god not three gods each person is fully god co equal and co eternal meaning that each person of the trinity has existed from eternity past and will always exist according to scripture they operate in perfect unity and consistency while maintaining distinct roles in creation redemption and the believer s daily life biblical foundations 1 old testament roots while the old testament does not use the term trinity many scholars note plural language applied to god that hints at a multi personal nature in the opening of genesis god created the heavens and the earth genesis 1 1 and the spirit of god was hovering over the surface of the waters genesis 1 2 later god says let us make man in our image after our likeness genesis 1 26 although the us can be understood in various ways many christians see this as an early foreshadowing of divine plurality within the one god 2 new testament revelation the new testament makes the triune nature of god much clearer jesus baptism at the baptism of jesus the holy spirit descends as a dove and the father s voice speaks from heaven luke 3 21 22 all three persons are simultaneously manifested the great commission jesus instructs his disciples to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit matthew 28 19 the singular name underscores the unity while the mention of father son and spirit shows distinction oneness with the father jesus says i and the father are one john 10 30 though distinct as persons the father and son share the same essence 3 unity and distinction scripture holds together statements affirming one god deuteronomy 6 4 hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one with passages that distinguish the father the son and the holy spirit further examples include john 14 16 17 jesus promises the holy spirit indicating the holy spirit is another comforter distinct from jesus yet proceeding from the father john 1 1 3 the word jesus was with god in the beginning and was god highlighting both distinction and unity historical development of the doctrine 1 early church writings church leaders and theologians in the first few centuries wrestled with how best to describe the nature of god revealed by scripture by the second and third centuries christian writers such as tertullian used the term trinitas latin for trinity to refer to the eternal three in one god 2 council of nicaea a d 325 responding to teachings that suggested jesus was not fully god the council of nicaea proclaimed that jesus the son is of the same essence as the father this council formed what is often referred to as the nicene creed affirming the divinity of the son and implicitly the trinitarian unity of god 3 council of constantinople a d 381 further affirmations followed regarding the full deity of the holy spirit clarifying that all three persons father son and holy spirit are equally and eternally god this affirmation built on the biblical record and the established creeds understanding each person of the trinity 1 the father he is often seen as the initiator in creation redemption and the overall plan of salvation passages like john 3 16 show the father s sending of the son as an act of love for the world 2 the son jesus christ jesus is god incarnate john 1 14 entering creation to atone for humanity s sins through his death and resurrection in scripture christ s deity is affirmed colossians 2 9 and his resurrection is central to salvation 1 corinthians 15 3 4 3 the holy spirit often seen as the executor of god s will the holy spirit convicts the world of sin john 16 8 regenerates believers titus 3 5 and empowers them to live godly lives galatians 5 22 23 the holy spirit is fully personal guiding believers into all truth john 16 13 interconnected roles in redemption from the beginning to the end of salvation history the persons of the trinity work in unison creation the father speaks the son is the divine word john 1 1 3 and the spirit hovers genesis 1 2 incarnation the father sends the son john 3 16 the spirit overshadows mary luke 1 35 and the son becomes flesh crucifixion jesus the son willingly offers himself john 10 17 18 obeying the father philippians 2 8 resurrection jesus rises from the dead by the power of god romans 6 4 and the holy spirit is said to be involved in giving life romans 8 11 salvation believers are chosen by the father ephesians 1 3 5 redeemed by the son s blood ephesians 1 7 and sealed by the holy spirit ephesians 1 13 common misunderstandings and clarifications 1 not three gods the trinity does not teach polytheism there is only one god who eternally and simultaneously exists as three persons the mystery lies in the unity of essence and distinction of persons 2 not modalism scripture does not depict god merely appearing in three forms father in the old testament son in the new then spirit after christ s ascension instead father son and holy spirit exist concurrently and relate to one another in love and fellowship john 17 5 3 terminology vs truth some object that trinity is not a biblical word while the term itself does not appear in scripture the concept is derived directly from the bible s consistent portrayal of the one god in three persons philosophical implications the concept of a triune god addresses profound philosophical questions about personhood unity and love in a single person deity model questions arise about how love or fellowship could exist prior to creation by contrast in the trinity each divine person has eternally related in perfect love and communion this shared love overflows into creation and redemption reflecting a god who is relational archaeological and historical corroborations early christian art and inscriptions discovered in places such as the roman catacombs along with ancient manuscript evidence like portions of john s gospel found among the bodmer papyri support the early and widespread belief that jesus was worshiped as god and that his followers understood the holy spirit as divine these findings align with theologians trinitarian writings in the second and third centuries showing that the belief in the trinity is not a later invention but deeply rooted in early christian testimony practical outworking in christian life the trinity shapes core christian practices prayer believers pray to the father in the name of the son through the power of the holy spirit ephesians 2 18 worship songs hymns and prayers honor all three persons reflecting worship that mirrors scripture s portrayal of god community christians are called to love and unity reflecting the divine relationship within the godhead john 17 21 23 mission proclaiming the gospel and making disciples matthew 28 19 highlights the triune name the father son and holy spirit and underscores the global call to salvation summary and conclusion the trinity stands as a central defining teaching of christianity revealing the nature of god as a unified divine being comprising three co eternal co equal persons though it transcends full human understanding scripture consistently depicts the father son and holy spirit as involved in creation redemption and the believer s life from the earliest stages of christian history to the present believers have understood this triune god to be worthy of worship and trust christians uphold the trinity as an essential doctrine because it positions jesus as fully divine and humanity s true redeemer places the holy spirit as the ever present divine guide and affirms the father as the loving architect of salvation thus the trinity is not an abstract theory but a vital living truth manifest in worship theology and daily christian practice"

bethlehem she and her husband joseph raised him in the city of nazareth in galilee and she was in jerusalem at his crucifixion and with the apostles after his ascension although her later life is not accounted in the bible catholic eastern orthodox and some protestant traditions believe that her body was raised into heaven at the end of her earthly life which is known in western christianity as

her immaculate conception and her bodily assumption into heaven 20 many protestants hold various views of mary s role that they perceive as being in accordance with the scriptures 21 22 the

hymns the celebration of several marian feast days in liturgy 22 the veneration of images and relics the construction of churches dedicated to her and pilgrimages to marian shrines many marian

\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 in the abbreviated form \u03bc\u03c1 \u03b8\u03c5 is an indication commonly attached to her image in byzantine icons the council stated that the church fathers did not hesitate to speak of the holy virgin as the mother of god 34 35 36 some marian titles have a direct scriptural basis for instance the title queen mother has been given to mary as she was the mother of jesus sometimes referred to as the king of kings due to his ancestral descent from king david 37 38 39 40 41 this is also based on the hebrew tradition of the queen mother the gebirah or great lady 42 43 other titles have arisen from reported miracles special appeals or occasions for calling on mary e in islam virgin mary depicted by muslim painter hossein nuri in islam

of mary she is often referred to by the honorific title sayyidatuna meaning our lady this title is in parallel to sayyiduna our lord used for the prophets 48 a related term of endearment is siddiqah 49 meaning she who confirms the truth and she who believes sincerely completely another title for mary is q\u0101nitah which signifies both constant submission to god and absorption in prayer and invocation in islam 50 she is also called tahira meaning one who has been purified and representing her status as one of two humans in creation to not be touched by satan at any point the other being jesus 51 in the quran she is described both as the daughter of imran and the sister of aaron and moses alluding to miriam from the hebrew bible 52 however the title of the sister of aaron is confirmed to be metaphorical which is a common figure of speech in arabic as per a hadith from the islamic prophet muhammad explaining mary was indeed named after miriam 53 life in ancient sources new testament the canonical gospels and the acts of the apostles are the primary sources of historical information about mary 54 55 they are almost contemporary sources as the synoptic gospels and the acts of the apostles are generally considered dating from around ad 66 90 while the gospel of john dates from ad 90 110 they provide limited information about mary as they primarily focus on the teaching of jesus and on his apostles 54 the historical reliability of the gospels and historical reliability of the acts of the apostles are subject to debate as it was common practice in early christian writings to mix historical facts with legendary stories 54 the earliest new testament account of mary is in the epistle to the galatians which was written before the gospels she is referred to as a woman and is not named but when the fullness of time had come god sent his son born of a woman born under the law galatians 4 4 55 mary is mentioned several times in the canonical gospels and the acts of the apostles in the book of revelation also part of the new testament the woman clothed with the sun revelation 12 1 12 5 6 66 is sometimes identified as mary genealogy the virgin s first seven steps mosaic from chora church c 12th century the new testament tells little of mary s early history the gospel of matthew gives a genealogy for jesus by his father s paternal line only identifying mary as the wife of joseph john 19 25 67 states that mary had a sister semantically it is unclear if this sister is the same as mary of clopas or if she is left unnamed jerome identifies mary of clopas as the sister of mary mother of jesus 68 according to the early 2nd century historian hegesippus mary of clopas was likely mary s sister in law understanding clopas cleophas to have been joseph s brother 69 according to the writer of luke mary was a relative of elizabeth wife of the priest zechariah of the priestly division of abijah who was herself part of the lineage of aaron and so of the tribe of levi 70 some of those who believe that the relationship with elizabeth was on the maternal side believe that mary like joseph was of the royal davidic line and so of the tribe of judah and that the genealogy of jesus presented in luke 3 from nathan is in fact the genealogy of mary while the genealogy from solomon given in matthew 1 is that of joseph 71 72 73 aaron s wife elisheba was of the tribe of judah so all their descendants are from both levi and judah 74 annunciation mary resided in her own house 75 in nazareth in galilee possibly with her parents and during her betrothal the first stage of a jewish marriage jewish girls were considered marriageable at the age of twelve years and six months though the actual age of the bride varied with circumstances the marriage was preceded by the betrothal after which the bride legally belonged to the bridegroom though she did not live with him till about a year later when the marriage was celebrated 76 the angel gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised messiah by conceiving him through the holy spirit and after initially expressing incredulity at the announcement she responded i am the handmaid of the lord let it be done unto me according to your word 77 f joseph planned to quietly divorce her but was told her conception was by the holy spirit in a dream by an angel of the lord the angel told him to not hesitate to take her as his wife which joseph did thereby formally completing the wedding rites 78 79 since the angel gabriel had told mary that elizabeth having previously been barren was then miraculously pregnant 80 mary hurried to see elizabeth who was living with her husband zechariah in the hill country in a city of juda mary arrived at the house and greeted elizabeth who called mary the mother of my lord and mary spoke the words of praise that later became known as the magnificat from her first word in the latin version 81 after about three months mary returned to her own house 82 birth of jesus the adoration of the shepherds a nativity scene in france according to the gospel of luke a decree of the roman emperor augustus required that joseph return to his hometown of bethlehem to register for a roman census g while he was there with mary she gave birth to jesus but because there was no place for them in the inn she used a manger as a cradle 84 p 14 85 it is not told how old mary was at the time of the nativity 86 but attempts have been made to infer it from the age of a typical jewish mother of that time mary joan winn leith represents the view that jewish girls typically married soon after the onset of puberty 87 while according to amram tropper jewish females generally married later in palestine and the western diaspora than in babylonia 88 some scholars hold the view that among them it typically happened between their mid and late teen years 89 or late teens and early twenties 86 88 after eight days the boy was circumcised according to jewish law and named jesus \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 yeshu a which means yahweh is salvation 90 after mary continued in the blood of her purifying another 33 days for a total of 40 days she brought her burnt offering and sin offering to the temple in jerusalem luke 2 22 91 so the priest could make atonement for her 92 they also presented jesus as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord luke 2 23 exodus 13 2 23 12 15 22 29 34 19 20 numbers 3 13 18 15 93 after the prophecies of simeon and the prophetess anna in luke 2 25 38 94 the family returned into galilee to their own city nazareth 95 according to the gospel of matthew magi coming from eastern regions arrived at bethlehem where jesus and his family were living and worshiped him joseph was then warned in a dream that king herod wanted to murder the infant and the family fled by night to egypt and stayed there for some time after herod s death in 4 bc they returned to nazareth in galilee rather than bethlehem because herod s son archelaus was the ruler of judaea 96 mary is involved in the only event in jesus adolescent life that is recorded in the new testament at the age of 12 jesus having become separated from his parents on their return journey from the passover celebration in jerusalem was found in the temple among the religious teachers 97 p 210 98 ministry of jesus mary was present when at her suggestion jesus worked his first miracle during a wedding at cana by turning water into wine 99 subsequently there are events when mary is mentioned along with the jesus brothers 100 according to epiphanius origen and eusebius these brothers would be sons of joseph from a previous marriage this view is still the official position of the eastern orthodox churches following jerome those would be actually jesus cousins children of mary s sister this remains the official roman catholic position for helvidius those would be full siblings of jesus born to mary and joseph after the firstborn jesus this has been the most common protestant position 101 102 103 the hagiography of mary and the holy family can be contrasted with other material in the gospels these references include an incident which can be interpreted as jesus rejecting his family in the new testament and his mother and his brothers arrived and standing outside they sent in a message asking for him and looking at those who sat in a circle around him jesus said these are my mother and my brothers whoever does the will of god is my brother and sister and mother 104 105 mary is also depicted as being present in a group of women at the crucifixion standing near the disciple whom jesus loved along with mary of clopas and mary magdalene 62 to which list matthew 27 56 106 adds the mother of the sons of zebedee presumably the salome mentioned in mark 15 40 107 after the ascension of jesus in acts 1 12 26 108 especially verse 14 mary is the only one other than the eleven apostles to be mentioned by name who abode in the upper room when they returned from mount olivet her presence with the apostles during the pentecost is not explicit although it has been held as a fact by christian tradition 109 from this time she disappears from the biblical accounts although it is held by catholics that she is again portrayed as the heavenly woman in the book of revelation 110 her death is not recorded in the scriptures but orthodox tradition tolerated also by catholics has her first dying a natural death known as the dormition of mary 111 and then soon after her body itself also being assumed taken bodily into heaven belief in the corporeal assumption of mary is a dogma of the catholic church in the latin and eastern catholic churches alike and is believed as well by the eastern orthodox church 112 113 the oriental orthodox church and parts of the anglican communion and continuing anglican movement 114 later writings according to the apocryphal gospel of james mary was the daughter of joachim and anne before mary s conception anne had been barren and was far advanced in years mary was given to service as a consecrated virgin in the temple in jerusalem when she was three years old 115 this was in spite of the patent impossibility of its premise that a girl could be kept in the temple of jerusalem along with some companions 116 some unproven apocryphal accounts such as the apocryphal gospel of james state that at the time of her betrothal to joseph mary was 12 14 years old 117 and suggests she was 16 during her pregnancy 118 1 her age during her pregnancy has varied up to 17 in apocryphal sources 119 120 in a large part apocryphal texts are historically unreliable 121 according to ancient jewish custom mary technically could have been betrothed at about 12 122 but some scholars hold the view that in judea it typically happened later 86 hyppolitus of thebes says that mary lived for 11 years after the death of her son jesus dying in 41 ad 123 the earliest extant biographical writing on mary is life of the virgin attributed to the 7th century saint maximus the confessor which portrays her as a key element of the early christian church after the death of jesus 124 125 126 religious perspectives christian christian marian perspectives include a great deal of diversity while some christians such as catholics and eastern orthodox have well established marian traditions protestants at large pay scant attention to mariological themes catholics eastern orthodox oriental orthodox lutherans and anglicans venerate the virgin mary this veneration especially takes the form of prayer for intercession with her son jesus christ additionally it includes composing poems and songs in mary s honor painting icons or carving statues of her and conferring titles on mary that reflect her position among the saints 30 31 128 129 catholic in the catholic church mary is accorded the title blessed beata \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 makaria in recognition of her assumption to heaven and her capacity to intercede on behalf of those who pray to her there is a difference between the usage of the term blessed as pertaining to mary and its usage as pertaining to a beatified person blessed as a marian title refers to her exalted state as being the greatest among the saints for a person who has been declared beatified on the other hand blessed simply indicates that they may be venerated despite not being canonized catholic teachings make clear that mary is not considered divine and prayers to her are not answered by her but rather by god through her intercession 130 the four catholic dogmas regarding mary are her status as theotokos or mother of god her perpetual virginity the immaculate conception and her bodily assumption into heaven 131 132 133 the blessed virgin mary the mother of jesus has a more central role in roman catholic teachings and beliefs than in any other major christian group not only do roman catholics have more theological doctrines and teachings that relate to mary but they have more feasts prayers devotional and venerative practices than any other group 128 the catechism of the catholic church states the church s devotion to the blessed virgin is intrinsic to christian worship 134 for centuries catholics have performed acts of consecration and entrustment to mary at personal societal and regional levels these acts may be directed to the virgin herself to the immaculate heart of mary and to the immaculate conception in catholic teachings consecration to mary does not diminish or substitute the love of god but enhances it for all consecration is ultimately made to god 135 136 following the growth of marian devotions in the 16th century catholic saints wrote books such as glories of mary and true devotion to mary that emphasized marian veneration and taught that the path to jesus is through mary 137 marian devotions are at times linked to christocentric devotions such as the alliance of the hearts of jesus and mary 138 major marian devotions include seven sorrows of mary rosary and scapular miraculous medal and reparations to mary 139 140 the months of may and october are traditionally marian months for roman catholics the daily rosary is encouraged in october and in may marian devotions take place in many regions 141 142 143 popes have issued a number of marian encyclicals and apostolic letters to encourage devotions to and the veneration of the virgin mary catholics place high emphasis on mary s roles as protector and intercessor and the catechism refers to mary as honored with the title mother of god to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs 134 144 145 146 147 key marian prayers include ave maria alma redemptoris mater sub tuum praesidium ave maris stella regina caeli ave regina caelorum and the magnificat 148 mary s participation in the processes of salvation and redemption has also been emphasized in the catholic tradition but they are not doctrines 149 150 151 152 pope john paul ii s 1987 encyclical redemptoris mater began with the sentence the mother of the redeemer has a precise place in the plan of salvation 153 in the 20th century both popes john paul ii and benedict xvi emphasized the marian focus of the catholic church cardinal joseph ratzinger later pope benedict xvi suggested a redirection of the whole church towards the program of pope john paul ii in order to ensure an authentic approach to christology via a return to the whole truth about mary 154 writing it is necessary to go back to mary if we want to return to that truth about jesus christ truth about the church and truth about man 154 there is significant diversity in the marian doctrines attributed to her primarily by the catholic church the key marian doctrines held primarily in catholicism can be briefly outlined as follows the acceptance of these marian doctrines by roman catholics and other christians can be summarized as follows 21 156 157 the title mother of god theotokos for mary was confirmed by the first council of ephesus held at the church of mary in 431 the council decreed that mary is the mother of god because her son jesus is one person who is both god and man divine and human 34 this doctrine is widely accepted by christians in general and the term mother of god had already been used within the oldest known prayer to mary the sub tuum praesidium which dates to around 250 ad 162 23 24 miraculous icon of our lady of tartak\u00f3w in blessed virgin mary church in \u0142ukawiec the virgin birth of jesus was an almost universally held belief among christians from the 2nd until the 19th century 163 it is included in the two most widely used christian creeds which state that jesus was incarnate of the holy spirit and the virgin mary the nicene creed in what is now its familiar form 164 and the apostles creed the gospel of matthew describes mary as a virgin who fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah 7 14 165 the authors of the gospels of matthew and luke consider jesus conception not the result of intercourse and assert that mary had no relations with man before jesus birth 166 this alludes to the belief that mary conceived jesus through the action of god the holy spirit and not through intercourse with joseph or anyone else 167 the doctrines of the assumption or dormition of mary relate to her death and bodily assumption to heaven roman catholic church has dogmatically defined the doctrine of the assumption which was done in 1950 by pope pius xii in munificentissimus deus whether mary died or not is not defined dogmatically however although a reference to the death of mary is made in munificentissimus deus in the eastern orthodox church the assumption of the virgin mary is believed and celebrated with her dormition where they believe she died catholics believe in the immaculate conception of mary as proclaimed ex cathedra by pope pius ix in 1854 namely that she was filled with grace from the very moment of her conception in her mother s womb and preserved from the stain of original sin the latin church has a liturgical feast by that name kept on 8 december 168 orthodox christians reject the immaculate conception dogma principally because their understanding of ancestral sin the greek term corresponding to the latin original sin differs from the augustinian interpretation and that of the catholic church 169 the perpetual virginity of mary asserts mary s real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving birth to the son of god made man the term ever virgin greek \u1f00\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 is applied in this case stating that mary remained a virgin for the remainder of her life making jesus her biological and only son whose conception and birth are held to be miraculous 131 167 170 the orthodox churches hold the position articulated in the protoevangelium of james that jesus brothers and sisters were joseph s children from a marriage prior to that of mary which had left him widowed roman catholic teaching follows the latin father jerome in considering them jesus cousins eastern orthodox 15th century icon of the theotokos god bearer eastern orthodox christianity includes a large number of traditions regarding the ever virgin mary the theotokos 171 the orthodox believe that she was and remained a virgin before and after christ s birth 31 the theotokia hymns to the theotokos are an essential part of the divine services in the eastern church and their positioning within the liturgical sequence effectively places the theotokos in the most prominent place after christ 172 within the orthodox tradition the order of the saints begins with the theotokos angels prophets apostles fathers and martyrs giving the virgin mary precedence over the angels she is also proclaimed as the lady of the angels 172 the views of the church fathers still play an important role in the shaping of orthodox marian perspective however the orthodox views on mary are mostly doxological rather than academic they are expressed in hymns praise liturgical poetry and the veneration of icons one of the most loved orthodox akathists standing hymns is devoted to mary and it is often simply called the akathist hymn 173 five of the twelve great feasts in orthodoxy are dedicated to mary 31 the sunday of orthodoxy directly links the virgin mary s identity as mother of god with icon veneration 174 a number of orthodox feasts are connected with the miraculous icons of the theotokos 172 the orthodox view mary as superior to all created beings although not divine 175 as such the designation of saint to mary as saint mary is not appropriate 176 the orthodox does not venerate mary as conceived immaculate gregory of nazianzus archbishop of constantinople in the 4th century ad speaking on the nativity of jesus christ argues that conceived by the virgin who first in body and soul was purified by the holy ghost he came forth as god with that which he had assumed one person in two natures flesh and spirit of which the latter defined the former 177 the orthodox celebrate the dormition of the theotokos rather than assumption 31 the protoevangelium of james an extra canonical book has been the source of many orthodox beliefs on mary the account of mary s life presented includes her consecration as a virgin at the temple at age three the high priest zachariah blessed mary and informed her that god had magnified her name among many generations zachariah placed mary on the third step of the altar whereby god gave her grace while in the temple mary was miraculously fed by an angel until she was 12 years old at that point an angel told zachariah to betroth mary to a widower in israel who would be indicated this story provides the theme of many hymns for the feast of presentation of mary and icons of the feast depict the story 178 the orthodox believe that mary was instrumental in the growth of christianity during the life of jesus and after his crucifixion and orthodox theologian sergei bulgakov has written the virgin mary is the centre invisible but real of the apostolic church theologians from the orthodox tradition have made prominent contributions to the development of marian thought and devotion john damascene c 650 c 750 was one of the greatest orthodox theologians among other marian writings he proclaimed the essential nature of mary s heavenly assumption or dormition and her meditative role it was necessary that the body of the one who preserved her virginity intact in giving birth should also be kept incorrupt after death it was necessary that she who carried the creator in her womb when he was a baby should dwell among the tabernacles of heaven 179 from her we have harvested the grape of life from her we have cultivated the seed of immortality for our sake she became mediatrix of all blessings in her god became man and man became god 180 more recently sergei bulgakov expressed the orthodox sentiments towards mary as follows 175 mary is not merely the instrument but the direct positive condition of the incarnation its human aspect christ could not have been incarnate by some mechanical process violating human nature it was necessary for that nature itself to say for itself by the mouth of the most pure human being behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word protestant protestants in general reject the veneration and invocation of the saints 21 1174 they share the belief that mary is the mother of jesus and blessed among women luke 1 42 181 but they generally do not agree that mary is to be venerated she is considered to be an outstanding example of a life dedicated to god 182 as such they tend not to accept certain church doctrines such as her being preserved from sin 183 theologian karl barth wrote that the heresy of the catholic church is its mariology 184 early protestantism had high regard for mary martin luther wrote that mary is full of grace proclaimed to be entirely without sin god s grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil 185 john calvin remarked it cannot be denied that god in choosing and destining mary to be the mother of his son granted her the highest honor h however calvin firmly rejected the notion that mary can intercede between christ and man 188 although calvin and huldrych zwingli honored mary as the mother of christ in the 16th century they did so less than martin luther 189 thus the idea of respect and high honor for mary was not rejected by the first protestants however they came to criticize the roman catholics for venerating mary following the council of trent in the 16th century as marian veneration became associated with catholics protestant interest in mary decreased during the age of the enlightenment any residual interest in mary within protestant churches almost disappeared although anglicans and lutherans continued to honor her 21 in the 20th century some protestants reacted in opposition to the catholic dogma of the assumption of mary 190 the tone of the second vatican council began to mend the ecumenical differences and protestants began to show interest in marian themes citation needed in 1997 and 1998 ecumenical dialogues between catholics and protestants took place but to date the majority of protestants disagree with marian veneration and some view it as a challenge to the authority of scripture 21 better source needed lutheran mary with an inscription referencing luke 1 46 47 in st j\u00fcrgen lutheran church in gettorf schleswig holstein evangelical lutheranism regards her as the blessed virgin mary with this codified in the formula of concord 24 191 the evangelical lutheran churches celebrate several marian feast days including the feast of the annunciation of the blessed virgin mary feast of the purification of the blessed virgin mary and the visitation of the blessed virgin mary 22 the formula of concord and the smalcald articles upheld by the lutheran churches teach the three marian dogmas of the virgin birth theotokos and the perpetual virginity of mary 23 24 the apology of the augsburg confession teaches that blessed mary prays for the church 192 theologians agree that martin luther adhered to the marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church he held fast to the belief that mary was a perpetual virgin and mother of god 193 194 special attention is given to the assertion that luther some 300 years before the dogmatization of the immaculate conception by pope pius ix in 1854 was a firm adherent of that view citation needed others maintain that luther in later years changed his position on the immaculate conception which at that time was undefined in the church maintaining however the sinlessness of mary throughout her life 195 196 for luther early in his life the assumption of mary was an understood fact although he later stated that the bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast important to him was the belief that mary and the saints do live on after death 197 198 199 throughout his career as a priest professor reformer luther preached taught and argued about the veneration of mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics his views are intimately linked to his christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety 200 luther while revering mary came to criticize the papists for blurring the line between high admiration of the grace of god wherever it is seen in a human being and religious service given to another creature he considered the roman catholic practice of celebrating saints days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to mary and other departed saints to be idolatry 201 202 his final thoughts on marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at wittenberg only a month before his death therefore when we preach faith that we should worship nothing but god alone the father of our lord jesus christ as we say in the creed i believe in god the father almighty and in jesus christ then we are remaining in the temple at jerusalem again this is my beloved son listen to him you will find him in a manger he alone does it but reason says the opposite what us are we to worship only christ indeed shouldn t we also honor the holy mother of christ she is the woman who bruised the head of the serpent hear us mary for thy son so honors thee that he can refuse thee nothing here bernard went too far in his homilies on the gospel missus est angelus 203 god has commanded that we should honor the parents therefore i will call upon mary she will intercede for me with the son and the son with the father who will listen to the son so you have the picture of god as angry and christ as judge mary shows to christ her breast and christ shows his wounds to the wrathful father that s the kind of thing this comely bride the wisdom of reason cooks up mary is the mother of christ surely christ will listen to her christ is a stern judge therefore i will call upon st george and st christopher no we have been by god s command baptized in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit just as the jews were circumcised 204 205 certain lutheran churches such as the anglo lutheran catholic church venerate mary and the saints in the same manner that roman catholics do and hold all marian dogmas as part of their faith 206 anglican the various churches that form the anglican communion and the continuing anglican movement have different views on marian doctrines and venerative practices given that there is no single church with universal authority within the communion and that the mother church the church of england understands itself to be both catholic and reformed 207 the anglican communion includes segments which still retain some veneration of mary 129 mary s special position within god s purpose of salvation as god bearer is recognized in a number of ways by some anglican christians 208 all the member churches of the anglican communion affirm in the historic creeds that jesus was born of the virgin mary and celebrates the feast days of the presentation of christ in the temple this feast is called in older prayer books the purification of the blessed virgin mary on 2 february the annunciation of our lord to the blessed virgin on 25 march was from before the time of bede until the 18th century new year s day in england the annunciation is called the annunciation of our lady in the 1662 book of common prayer anglicans also celebrate in the visitation of the blessed virgin on 31 may though in some provinces the traditional date of 2 july is kept the feast of the st mary the virgin is observed on the traditional day of the assumption 15 august the nativity of the blessed virgin is kept on 8 september 129 the conception of the blessed virgin mary is kept in the 1662 book of common prayer on 8 december in certain anglican parishes of anglo catholic churchmanship this feast is called the immaculate conception again the assumption of mary is believed in by most anglo catholics but is considered a pious opinion by moderate anglicans reformed anglicans reject the celebration of these feasts 129 prayers and venerative practices vary greatly for instance as of the 19th century following the oxford movement anglo catholics frequently pray the rosary the angelus regina caeli and other litanies and anthems of mary reminiscent of catholic practices 209 conversely low church anglicans rarely invoke the blessed virgin except in certain hymns such as the second stanza of ye watchers and ye holy ones 208 210 the anglican society of mary was formed in 1931 and maintains chapters in many countries the purpose of the society is to foster devotion to mary among anglicans 129 211 high church anglicans espouse doctrines that are closer to roman catholics and retain veneration for mary such as anglican pilgrimages to our lady of lourdes which have taken place since 1963 and pilgrimages to our lady of walsingham which have taken place for hundreds of years 212 historically there has been enough common ground between roman catholics and anglicans on marian issues that in 2005 a joint statement called mary grace and hope in christ was produced through ecumenical meetings of anglicans and roman catholic theologians this document informally known as the seattle statement is not formally endorsed by either the catholic church or the anglican communion but is viewed by its authors as the beginning of a joint understanding of mary 129 213 methodist methodists do not have any additional teachings on the virgin mary except from what is mentioned in scripture and the ecumenical creeds as such methodists generally accept the doctrine of the virgin birth but reject the doctrine of the immaculate conception 214 john wesley the principal founder of the methodist movement within the church of england believed that mary continued a pure and unspotted virgin thus upholding the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of mary 215 216 contemporary methodism holds that mary was a virgin before during and immediately after the birth of christ 217 218 in addition some methodists also hold the doctrine of the assumption of mary as a pious opinion 219 nontrinitarian nontrinitarians such as unitarians christadelphians jehovah s witnesses and latter day saints 220 also acknowledge mary as the biological mother of jesus christ but most reject any immaculate conception and do not recognize marian titles such as mother of god the latter day saint movement s view affirms the virgin birth of jesus 221 and christ s divinity but only as a separate being than god the father the book of mormon refers to mary by name in prophecies and describes her as most beautiful and fair above all other virgins 222 and as a precious and chosen vessel 223 224 in nontrinitarian groups that are also christian mortalists mary is not seen as an intercessor between humankind and jesus whom mortalists would consider asleep awaiting resurrection 225 jewish the issue of the parentage of jesus in the talmud also affects jewish views of mary however the talmud does not mention mary by name and is considerate rather than only polemic 226 227 the story about panthera is also found in the toledot yeshu the literary origins of which can not be traced with any certainty and given that it is unlikely to go before the 4th century the time is too late to include authentic remembrances of jesus 228 the blackwell companion to jesus states that the toledot yeshu has no historical facts and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to christianity 229 the tales from the toledot yeshu did impart a negative picture of mary to ordinary jewish readers 230 the circulation of the toledot yeshu was widespread among european and middle eastern jewish communities since the 9th century 231 the name panthera may be a distortion of the term parthenos virgin and raymond e brown considers the story of panthera a fanciful explanation of the birth of jesus that includes very little historical evidence 232 robert van voorst states that because toledot yeshu is a medieval document with its lack of a fixed form and orientation towards a popular audience it is most unlikely to have reliable historical information 233 stacks of the copies of the talmud were burnt upon a court order after the 1240 disputation for allegedly containing material defaming the character of mary 230 islamic persian miniature of mary and jesus the virgin mary holds a singularly exalted place in islam and she is considered by the quran to have been the greatest woman in the history of humankind the islamic scripture recounts the divine promise given to mary as being o mary surely allah has selected you purified you and chosen you over all women of the world mary is often referred to by muslims by the honorific title sayedetina our lady she is mentioned in the quran as the daughter of imran 234 moreover mary is the only woman named in the quran and she is mentioned or referred to in the scripture a total of 50 times i mary holds a singularly distinguished and honored position among women in the quran a sura chapter in the quran is titled maryam mary the only sura in the quran named after a woman in which the story of mary maryam and jesus isa is recounted according to the view of jesus in islam 13 birth in a narration of hadith from imam ja far al sadiq he mentions that allah revealed to imran i will grant you a boy blessed one who will cure the blind and the leper and one who will raise the dead by my permission and i will send him as an apostle to the children of israel then imran related the story to his wife hannah the mother of mary when she became pregnant she conceived it was a boy but when she gave birth to a girl she stated oh my lord verily i have delivered a female and the male is not like the female for a girl will not be a prophet to which allah replies in the quran allah knows better what has been delivered 3 36 when allah bestowed jesus to mary he fulfilled his promise to imran 235 motherhood islamic miniature of maryam in labor shaking a date palm with isa and hidden voice below mary was declared uniquely along with jesus to be a sign of god to humanity 236 as one who guarded her chastity 50 an obedient one 50 and dedicated by her mother to allah whilst still in the womb 51 uniquely amongst women accepted into service by god 237 cared for by one of the prophets as per islam zakariya zacharias 237 that in her childhood she resided in the temple and uniquely had access to al mihrab understood to be the holy of holies and was provided with heavenly provisions by god 237 234 mary is also called a chosen one 238 a purified one 238 a truthful one 239 her child conceived through a word from god 240 and chosen you above the women of the worlds the material and heavenly worlds 238 the quran relates detailed narrative accounts of maryam mary in two places and these state beliefs in both the immaculate conception of mary and the virgin birth of jesus 241 242 243 the account given in is nearly identical with that in the gospel according to luke and both of these luke sura 19 begin with an account of the visitation of an angel upon zakariya zecharias and good news of the birth of yahya john followed by the account of the annunciation it mentions how mary was informed by an angel that she would become the mother of jesus through the actions of god alone 244 in the islamic tradition mary and jesus were the only children who could not be touched by satan at the moment of their birth for god imposed a veil between them and satan 245 246 according to the author shabbir akhtar the islamic perspective on mary s immaculate conception is compatible with the catholic doctrine of the same topic o people of the book do not go to extremes regarding your faith say nothing about allah except the truth the messiah jesus son of mary was no more than a messenger of allah and the fulfilment of his word through mary and a spirit created by a command from him so believe in allah and his messengers and do not say trinity stop for your own good allah is only one god glory be to him he is far above having a son to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and allah is sufficient as a trustee of affairs the quran says that jesus was the result of a virgin birth the most detailed account of the annunciation and birth of jesus is provided in suras 3 and 19 of the quran where it is written that god sent an angel to announce that she could shortly expect to bear a son despite being a virgin 249 druze faith the druze faith holds the virgin mary known as sayyida maryam in high regard 127 although the druze religion is distinct from mainstream islam and christianity it incorporates elements from both and honors many of their figures including the virgin mary 127 the druze revere mary as a holy and pure figure embodying virtue and piety 250 127 she is respected not only for her role as the mother of messiah jesus but also for her spiritual purity and dedication to god 250 127 in regions where druze and christians coexist such as parts of lebanon syria and israel the veneration of mary often reflects a blend of traditions 251 shared pilgrimage sites and mutual respect for places like the church of saidet et tall\u00e9 in deir el qamar 252 the our lady of lebanon shrine in harrisa the our lady of saidnaya monastery in saidnaya and the stella maris monastery in haifa exemplify this 251 historical records and writings by authors like pierre marie martin and glenn bowman show that druze leaders and community members have historically shown deep reverence for marian sites 14 they often sought her intercession before battles or during times of need demonstrating a cultural and spiritual integration of marian veneration into their religious practices 14 bah\u00e1 \u00ed faith the bah\u00e1 \u00ed faith venerates mary as the mother of jesus the kit\u00e1b i \u00edq\u00e1n the primary theological work of the bah\u00e1 \u00ed religion describes mary as that most beauteous countenance and that veiled and immortal countenance the bah\u00e1 \u00ed writings claim jesus christ was conceived of the holy ghost 253 and assert that in the bah\u00e1 \u00ed faith the reality of the mystery of the immaculacy of the virgin mary is confessed 254 biblical scholars the statement found in matthew 1 25 that joseph did not have sexual relations with mary before she gave birth to jesus has been debated among scholars with some saying that she did not remain a virgin and some saying that she was a perpetual virgin 255 other scholars contend that the greek word heos until denotes a state up to a point but does not mean that the state ended after that point and that matthew 1 25 does not confirm or deny the virginity of mary after the birth of jesus 256 257 258 according to biblical scholar bart ehrman the hebrew word almah meaning young woman of childbearing age was translated into greek as parthenos which often though not always refers to a young woman who has never had sex in isaiah 7 14 it is commonly believed by christians to be the prophecy of the virgin mary referred to in matthew 1 23 259 while matthew and luke give differing versions of the virgin birth john quotes the uninitiated philip and the disbelieving jews gathered at galilee referring to joseph as jesus father 260 261 262 263 other biblical verses have also been debated for example the reference made by paul the apostle that jesus was made of the seed of david according to the flesh romans 1 3 264 meaning that he was a descendant of david through joseph 265 pre christian rome from the early stages of christianity belief in the virginity of mary and the virgin conception of jesus as stated in the gospels holy and supernatural was used by detractors both political and religious as a topic for discussions debates and writings specifically aimed to challenge the divinity of jesus and thus christians and christianity alike 266 in the 2nd century as part of his anti christian polemic the true word the pagan philosopher celsus contended that jesus was actually the illegitimate son of a roman soldier named panthera 267 the church father origen dismissed this assertion as a complete fabrication in his apologetic treatise against celsus 268 how far celsus sourced his view from jewish sources remains a subject of discussion 269 christian devotions history 2nd century justin martyr was among the first to draw a parallel between eve and mary this derives from his comparison of adam and jesus in his dialogue with trypho written sometime between 155 and 167 270 he explains he became man by the virgin in order that the disobedience which proceeded from the serpent might receive its destruction in the same manner in which it derived its origin for eve who was a virgin and undefiled having conceived the word of the serpent brought forth disobedience and death but the virgin mary received faith and joy when the angel gabriel announced the good tidings to her that the spirit of the lord would come upon her and the power of the highest would overshadow her wherefore also the holy thing begotten of her is the son of god and she replied be it unto me according to thy word and by her has he been born to whom we have proved so many scriptures refer and by whom god destroys both the serpent and those angels and men who are like him but works deliverance from death to those who repent of their wickedness and believe upon him 271 it is possible that the teaching of mary as the new eve was part of the apostolic tradition rather than merely justin martyr s own creation according to serafim sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 272 irenaeus bishop of lyon also takes up this parallel in against heresies written about the year 182 273 in accordance with this design mary the virgin is found obedient saying behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to your word luke 1 38 but eve was disobedient for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin having become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and to the entire human race so also did mary having a man betrothed to her and being nevertheless a virgin by yielding obedience become the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race and on this account does the law term a woman betrothed to a man the wife of him who had betrothed her although she was as yet a virgin thus indicating the back reference from mary to eve for the lord having been born the first begotten of the dead revelation 1 5 and receiving into his bosom the ancient fathers has regenerated them into the life of god he having been made himself the beginning of those that live as adam became the beginning of those who die 1 corinthians 15 20 22 wherefore also luke commencing the genealogy with the lord carried it back to adam indicating that it was he who regenerated them into the gospel of life and not they him and thus also it was that the knot of eve s disobedience was loosed by the obedience of mary for what the virgin eve had bound fast through unbelief this did the virgin mary set free through faith 274 during the second century the gospel of james was also written according to stephen j shoemaker its interest in mary as a figure in her own right and its reverence for her sacred purity mark the beginnings of marian piety within early christianity 275 3rd to 5th centuries during the age of martyrs and at the latest in the fourth century the majority of the most essential ideas of marian devotion already appeared in some form in the writings of the church fathers apocrypha and visual arts the lack of sources makes it unclear whether the devotion to mary played a role in liturgical use during the first centuries of christianity 276 in the 4th century marian devotion in a liturgical context becomes evident 277 the earliest known marian prayer the sub tuum praesidium or beneath thy protection is from the 3rd century perhaps 270 and its text was rediscovered in 1917 on a papyrus in egypt 278 279 according to some sources theonas of alexandria consecrated one of the first holy places dedicated to mary during the late 3rd century an even earlier place has been found in nazareth dated to the previous century by some scholars 280 following the edict of milan in 313 by the 5th century artistic images of mary began to appear in public and larger churches were being dedicated to mary such as the basilica di santa maria maggiore in rome 281 282 283 at the council of ephesus in 431 mary was officially declared the theotokos meaning god bearer 284 or mother of god the term had possibly been used for centuries 285 or at least since the early 300s when it seems to have already been in established use 286 the council of ephesus was long thought to have been held at a church in ephesus which had been dedicated to mary about a hundred years before 287 288 289 though recent archeological surveys indicate that st mary s church in ephesus did not exist at the time of the council or at least the building was not dedicated to mary before 500 290 the church of the seat of mary in judea was built shortly after the introduction of marian liturgy at the council of ephesus in 456 by a widow named ikelia 291 according to the 4th century heresiologist epiphanius of salamis the virgin mary was worshipped as a mother goddess in the christian sect of collyridianism which was found throughout arabia sometime during the 300s ad collyridianism had women performing priestly acts and made bread offerings to the virgin mary the group was condemned as heretical by the roman catholic church and was preached against by epiphanius of salamis who wrote about the group in his writings titled panarion 292 byzantium during the era of the byzantine empire mary was venerated as the virginal mother of god and as an intercessor 293 ephesus is a cultic centre of mary the site of the first church dedicated to her and the rumoured place of her death ephesus was previously a centre for worship of artemis a virgin goddess the temple of artemis there is regarded as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world the cult of mary was furthered by queen theodora in the 6th century 294 295 according to william e phipps in the book survivals of roman religion 296 gordon laing argues convincingly that the worship of artemis as both virgin and mother at the grand ephesian temple contributed to the veneration of mary 297 middle ages madonna of humility by fra angelico c 1430 a traditional depiction of mary wearing blue clothes the middle ages saw many legends about mary her parents and even her grandparents 298 mary s popularity increased dramatically from the 12th century 299 linked to the roman catholic church s designation of mary as mediatrix 300 301 post reformation our lady of sorrows by giovanni battista salvi da sassoferrato 17th century over the centuries devotion and veneration to mary has varied greatly among christian traditions for instance while protestants show scant attention to marian prayers or devotions of all the saints whom the orthodox venerate the most honored is mary who is considered more honorable than the cherubim and more glorious than the seraphim 31 orthodox theologian sergei bulgakov wrote love and veneration for the virgin is the soul of orthodox piety a faith in christ which does not include his mother is another faith another christianity from that of the orthodox church 175 although the catholics and the orthodox may honor and venerate mary they do not view her as divine nor do they worship her roman catholics view mary as subordinate to christ but uniquely so in that she is seen as above all other creatures 302 similarly bulgakov wrote that the orthodox view mary as superior to all created beings and ceaselessly pray for her intercession however she is not considered a substitute for the one mediator who is christ 175 let mary be in honor but let worship be given to the lord he wrote 303 similarly catholics do not worship mary as a divine being but rather hyper venerate her in roman catholic theology the term hyperdulia is reserved for marian veneration latria for the worship of god and dulia for the veneration of other saints and angels 304 the definition of the three level hierarchy of latria hyperdulia and dulia goes back to the second council of nicaea in 787 305 devotions to artistic depictions of mary vary among christian traditions there is a long tradition of catholic marian art and no image permeates catholic art as does the image of madonna and child 306 the icon of the virgin theotokos with christ is without doubt the most venerated icon in the orthodox church 307 both roman catholic and orthodox christians venerate images and icons of mary given that the second council of nicaea in 787 permitted their veneration with the understanding that those who venerate the image are venerating the reality of the person it represents 308 and the 842 synod of constantinople confirming the same 309 according to orthodox piety and traditional practice however believers ought to pray before and venerate only flat two dimensional icons and not three dimensional statues 310 the anglican position towards mary is in general more conciliatory than that of protestants at large and in a book he wrote about praying with the icons of mary rowan williams former archbishop of canterbury said it is not only that we cannot understand mary without seeing her as pointing to christ we cannot understand christ without seeing his attention to mary 129 311 on 4 september 1781 11 families of pobladores arrived from the gulf of california and established a city in the name of king carlos iii the small town was named el pueblo de nuestra se\u00f1ora de los \u00e1ngeles de la porci\u00fancula after our lady of the angels a city that today is known simply as los angeles in an attempt to revive the custom of religious processions within the archdiocese of los angeles in september 2011 the queen of angels foundation and founder mark anchor albert inaugurated an annual grand marian procession in the heart of downtown los angeles historic core this yearly procession held on the last saturday of august and intended to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of the city of los angeles begins at the cathedral of our lady of the angels and concludes at the parish of la iglesia de nuestra se\u00f1ora reina de los angeles which is part of the los angeles plaza historic district better known as la placita 312 313 feasts the earliest feasts that relate to mary grew out of the cycle of feasts that celebrated the nativity of jesus given that according to the gospel of luke luke 2 22 40 314 40 days after the birth of jesus along with the presentation of jesus at the temple mary was purified according to jewish customs the feast of the purification began to be celebrated by the 5th century and became the feast of simeon in byzantium 315 in the 7th and 8th centuries four more marian feasts were established in eastern christianity in the west a feast dedicated to mary just before christmas was celebrated in the churches of milan and ravenna in italy in the 7th century the four roman marian feasts of purification annunciation assumption and nativity of mary were gradually and sporadically introduced into england by the 11th century 315 over time the number and nature of feasts and the associated titles of mary and the venerative practices that accompany them have varied a great deal among diverse christian traditions overall there are significantly more titles feasts and venerative marian practices among roman catholics than any other christians traditions 128 some such feasts relate to specific events such as the feast of our lady of victory based on the 1571 victory of the papal states in the battle of lepanto 316 317 differences in feasts may also originate from doctrinal issues the feast of the assumption is such an example given that there is no agreement among all christians on the circumstances of the death dormition or assumption of mary the feast of assumption is celebrated among some denominations and not others 30 318 while the roman catholic church celebrates the feast of the assumption on 15 august some eastern catholics celebrate it as dormition of the theotokos and may do so on 28 august if they follow the julian calendar the eastern orthodox also celebrate it as the dormition of the theotokos one of their 12 great feasts protestants do not celebrate this or any other marian feasts 30 relics the veneration of marian relics used to be common practice before the reformation it was later largely surpassed by the veneration of marian images bodily relics as mary s body is believed by most christians to have been taken up into the glory of heaven her bodily relics have been limited to hair nails and breast milk according to john calvin s 1543 treatise on relics her hair was exposed for veneration in several churches including in rome saint flour cluny and nevers 319 in this book calvin criticized the veneration of the holy milk due to the lack of biblical references to it and the doubts about the veracity of such relics with regard to the milk there is not perhaps a town a convent or nunnery where it is not shown in large or small quantities indeed had the virgin been a wet nurse her whole life or a dairy she could not have produced more than is shown as hers in various parts how they obtained all this milk they do not say and it is superfluous here to remark that there is no foundation in the gospels for these foolish and blasphemous extravagances although the veneration of marian bodily relics is no longer a common practice today there are some remaining traces of it such as the chapel of the milk grotto in bethlehem named after mary s milk clothes clothes which are believed to have belonged to mary include the cincture of the theotokos kept in the vatopedi monastery and her holy girdle kept in holy belt church homs other relics are said to have been collected during later marian apparitions such as her robe veil and part of her belt which were kept in blachernae church in constantinople after she appeared there during the 10th century these relics now lost are celebrated by the eastern orthodox and byzantine catholic churches as the intercession of the theotokos few other objects are said to have been touched or given by mary during apparitions notably a 1531 image printed on a tilma known as our lady of guadalupe belonging to juan diego places the chapel based on the claimed house of mary in ephesus places where mary is believed to have lived include the basilica della santa casa in loreto marche and the house of the virgin mary in ephesus eastern christians believe that she died and was put in the tomb of the virgin mary near jerusalem before the assumption the belief that mary s house was in ephesus is recent as it was claimed in the 19th century based on the visions of anne catherine emmerich an augustinian nun in germany 320 321 it has since been named as the house of the virgin mary by roman catholic pilgrims who consider it the place where mary lived until her assumption 322 323 324 325 the gospel of john states that mary went to live with the disciple whom jesus loved 326 traditionally identified as john the evangelist 327 and john the apostle irenaeus and eusebius of caesarea wrote in their histories that john later went to ephesus which may provide the basis for the early belief that mary also lived in ephesus with john 328 329 the apparition of our lady of the pillar in the first century was believed to be a bilocation as it occurred in spain while mary was living in ephesus or jerusalem the pillar on which she was standing during the apparition is believed to be kept in the cathedral basilica of our lady of the pillar in zaragoza and is therefore venerated as a relics as it was in physical contact with mary in arts iconography in paintings mary is traditionally portrayed in blue this tradition can trace its origin to the byzantine empire from c 500 ad where blue was the colour of an empress a more practical explanation for the use of this colour is that in medieval and renaissance europe the blue pigment was derived from the rock lapis lazuli a stone of greater value than gold which was imported from afghanistan beyond a painter s retainer patrons were expected to purchase any gold or lapis lazuli to be used in the painting hence it was an expression of devotion and glorification to swathe the virgin in gowns of blue transformations in visual depictions of mary from the 13th to 15th centuries mirror her social standing within the church and in society 330 traditional representations of mary include the crucifixion scene called stabat mater 331 332 while not recorded in the gospel accounts mary cradling the dead body of her son is a common motif in art called a piet\u00e0 or pity in the egyptian eritrean and ethiopian tradition mary has been portrayed in story and paint for centuries 333 beginning in the 1600s however highland ethiopians began portraying mary performing a variety of miracles for the faithful including paintings of her giving water to a thirsty dog healing monks with her breast milk and saving a man eaten by a crocodile 334 over 1 000 such stories about her exist in this tradition and about one hundred of those have hundreds of paintings each in various manuscripts adding up to thousands of paintings 335 cinematic portrayals mary has been portrayed in various films and on television including music see also notes references",

1852 8 he found school difficult and was frequently in trouble often punished he had nothing kind to say of his teachers in his writings his poem the educator tells of an intelligent but sinister

it further 11 riley s school attendance was sporadic and he graduated from grade eight at age 20 in 1869 in an 1892 newspaper article riley confessed he knew little of mathematics geography or science and his understanding of proper grammar was poor 12 later critics like henry beers pointed to his poor education as the reason for his success in writing his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity 13 childhood influences edit the old swimming hole that appears in riley s poems is now a large and well used park on the east side of greenfield riley lived

german tramp his father hired to work at the family home 3 riley picked up the cadence and character of the dialect of central indiana from travelers along the old national road their speech greatly influenced the hundreds of poems he wrote in 19th century hoosier dialect 14 his mother often told him stories of fairies trolls and giants and read him children s poems she was very superstitious and influenced riley with many of her beliefs they both placed spirit rappings in their homes on places like tables and bureaux to capture any spirits that may have been wandering about this influence can be found in many of his works including flying islands of the night 15 16 as was common at that time riley and his friends had few toys and amused themselves with activities with his mother s help riley began creating plays and theatricals which he and his friends would practice and perform in the back of a local grocery store as he grew older the boys named their troupe the adelphians and began to hold their shows in barns where they could fit larger audiences 17 riley wrote of these early performances in his poem when we first played show referring to himself as jamesy 18 many of

every one 18 riley s father enlisted in the union army during the american civil war leaving his wife to manage the family home while he was away the family took in a 12 year old orphan named mary alice allie smith she was the inspiration for riley s poem little orphant annie riley had intended titling the poem little orphant allie but a typesetter s error changed it during printing 10 20 21 22 finding poetry edit riley s father returned from the war partially paralyzed he was unable to continue working in his legal practice and the family soon fell into financial distress the war s negative effects soon caused his relationship with his family to deteriorate he opposed riley s interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career the family finances finally disintegrated they were forced to sell their town home in april 1870 and return to their country farm 23 riley s mother was able to keep peace in the family but after her death in august from heart disease riley and his father had a final break he blamed his mother s death on his father s failure to care for her in her final weeks 13 24 he continued to regret the loss of his childhood home he wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war subsequent poverty and his mother s death after the events of 1870 he developed an addiction to alcohol and struggled with it for the rest of his life 13

leaving greenfield in november 1870 he was recruited as a bible salesman and began working in the nearby town of rushville indiana 26 the job provided little income and he returned to greenfield in march 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter he completed it and opened a business in greenfield creating and maintaining signs his earliest known poems are verses he wrote as clever advertisements for his customers 27 riley began participating in local theater productions with the adelphians to earn extra income during the winter months when the demand for painting declined riley began writing poetry which he mailed to his brother who lived in indianapolis he acted as riley s agent and offered the poems to the indianapolis mirror newspaper free of charge his first poem was featured on march 30 1872 under the pseudonym jay whit 28 riley wrote more than 20 poems to the newspaper including one that was featured on the front page 28 29 in july 1872 after becoming convinced sales would provide more income than sign painting he joined the mccrillus company based in anderson indiana 30 the company sold patent medicines that they marketed using small traveling shows around indiana riley joined the act as a huckster calling himself the painter poet he traveled with the act composing poetry and performing at the shows 31 32 after his act he sold tonics to his audience sometimes employing dishonesty during one stop riley presented himself as a formerly blind painter who had been cured by a tonic using himself as evidence to encourage the audience to purchase it 33 riley began sending poems to his brother again in february 1873 about the same time he and several friends began an advertisement company 34 the men traveled around indiana creating large billboard like signs on the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that were visible from a distance 35 the company was financially successful but riley was continually drawn to poetry in october he traveled to south bend where he took a job at stockford blowney painting verses on signs for a month the shortness of his stay at this job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time 36 in early 1874 riley returned to greenfield to become a full time writer 37 in february he submitted a poem titled at last to a connecticut newspaper the danbury news 38 the editors accepted it paid him for it and wrote him a letter encouraging him to submit more riley found the note and his first payment inspiring 39 he began submitting poems regularly to the editors 40 but after the newspaper shut down in 1875 riley was left without a paying publisher he began traveling and performing with the adelphians around central indiana to earn an income while he searched for a new publisher in august 1875 he joined another traveling tonic show run by the wizard oil company 41 n 2 birthplace and homes of james whitcomb riley with portraits of the poet at different periods of his life early career edit newspaper work edit riley began writing to the well known american poet henry wadsworth longfellow during late 1875 seeking his endorsement to help him start a career as a poet 42 he submitted many poems to longfellow whom he considered the greatest living poet not receiving a prompt response he sent similar letters to john townsend trowbridge and several other prominent writers asking for an endorsement 43 longfellow finally replied in a brief letter telling riley i have read the poems in great pleasure and think they show a true poetic faculty and insight 44 45 riley carried the letter with him everywhere and hoping to receive a job offer and to create a market for his poetry he began sending poems to dozens of newspapers touting longfellow s endorsement among the newspapers to take an interest in his poems was the indianapolis journal a major republican party metropolitan newspaper in indiana among the first poems it purchased from him were song of the new year an empty nest and a short story entitled a remarkable man 46 the editors of the anderson democrat discovered riley s poems in the indianapolis journal and offered him a job as a reporter in february 1877 47 48 riley accepted he worked gathering local news writing articles and assisting with typesetting he continued to write poems regularly for the newspaper and to sell other poems to larger newspapers 49 during the year riley spent working in anderson he met and courted edora mysers the couple became engaged but ended the relationship after they had decided against marriage in august 50 despite local success at having his poems published his submissions continued to be rejected by established eastern periodicals as being below their standards riley began formulating a plot to prove his work was of good quality and that it was being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east he wrote a poem imitating the style of edgar allan poe and submitted it to the kokomo dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost poe poem the dispatch published the poem and reported it as such 51 52 riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in chicago boston and new york to gauge their reaction they were disappointed while a few newspapers believed the poem was authentic most did not claiming the quality was too poor to be written by poe 53 a dispatch employee learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the kokomo tribune which published an expos\u00e9 that outed riley as a conspirator behind the hoax the revelation damaged the dispatch s credibility and harmed riley s reputation 54 55 in the aftermath of the poe plot riley was dismissed from the democrat he returned to greenfield to spend time writing poetry 56 he met clara louise bottsford a school teacher boarding in his father s home they found they had much in common particularly their love of literature the couple began a 12 year intermittent relationship riley s longest 57 in mid 1878 the couple had their first breakup caused partly by riley s alcoholism riley made a first attempt to give up liquor by joining a local temperance organization but quit after a few weeks 58 performing poet edit without a steady income his financial situation worsened riley began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines including scribner s monthly but was informed that although it showed promise his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications 59 60 locally he was still dealing with the stigma of the poe plot the indianapolis journal and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry leaving him desperate for income on the advice of a friend in january 1878 riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings in exchange he received a portion of the profit his performances earned these circuits were popular at the time and riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings 61 in august 1878 he followed indiana governor james d williams as speaker at a civic event in a small town near indianapolis he recited a recently composed poem a childhood home of long ago telling of life in pioneer indiana the poem was well received and was given good reviews by several newspapers 62 flying islands of the night is the only play riley wrote and published written while he was traveling with the adelphians but never performed the play has similarities to a midsummer night s dream which riley may have used as a model 63 it concerns a kingdom besieged by evil forces of a sinister queen who is defeated eventually by an angel like heroine 64 most reviews were positive riley published the play and it became popular in the central indiana area during late 1878 helping him to convince newspapers to accept his poetry again in november 1879 he was offered a position as a columnist at the indianapolis journal and accepted after being encouraged by e b matindale the paper s chief editor 65 although the play and his newspaper work helped expose him to a wider audience the chief source of his increasing popularity was his performances on the lecture circuit he gave both dramatic and comedic readings of his poetry and by early 1879 could guarantee large crowds when he performed 66 in an 1894 article hamlin garland wrote that riley s celebrity resulted from his reading talent saying his vibrant individual voice his flexible lips his droll glance united to make him at once poet and comedian comedian in the sense in which makes for tears as well as for laughter 67 although he was a good performer his acts were not entirely original in style he frequently copied practices developed by samuel clemens and will carleton 68 his tour in 1880 took him to every city in indiana where he was introduced by local dignitaries and other popular figures including novelist maurice thompson with whom he began to develop a close friendship 69 developing and maintaining publicity became a constant job requiring more of his attention as his fame grew keeping his alcohol addiction secret maintaining the persona of a simple rural poet and a friendly common person became most important 70 riley identified these traits as the basis of his popularity during the mid 1880s and wrote of his need to maintain a fictional persona 68 he encouraged the stereotype by writing poetry he thought would help build his identity he was aided by editorials he wrote and submitted to the indianapolis journal offering observations on events from his perspective as a humble rural poet 71 he changed his appearance to look more mainstream and began by shaving his mustache off and abandoning the flamboyant dress he employed in his early circuit tours 72 by 1880 his poems were published nationally and receiving positive reviews tom johnson s quit was carried by newspapers in twenty states thanks in part to the careful cultivation of his popularity 71 riley became frustrated that despite his growing acclaim he found it difficult to achieve financial success 73 in the early 1880s in addition to his steady performing riley began producing many poems to increase his income half of his poems were written during this period the constant labor had adverse effects on his health which was worsened by his drinking at the urging of maurice thompson he again attempted to stop drinking liquor but was unable to give it up for more than a few months 74 indianapolis journal edit newspaper poet edit riley moved to indianapolis at the end of 1879 to begin his employment as a newspaper poet with the indianapolis journal it was the only metropolitan newspaper there with daily editions and had a wide readership he wrote a regular society column that often included verses of poetry 75 76 thereafter riley met many prominent people and began a close friendship with eugene v debs 77 he enjoyed riley s works and often complimented his sentiments 78 riley had used the pseudonym jay whit since he began writing poetry but finally began to use his own name in april 1881 79 riley renewed his relationship with bottsford in 1880 and the two corresponded frequently their relationship remained unstable but riley became deeply attached to her she inspired his poem the werewife which told of a perfect wife who could suddenly become a demonic monster 80 bottsford pressed riley for marriage several times but he refused 81 they broke off their relationship a second time in 1881 when she discovered his correspondence with two other women 82 and found he had taken a secret vacation to wisconsin with one of them 83 riley s alcoholism influenced some of his poems during his time working for the journal these included on quitting california john golliher s third womern sic and the dismal fate of tit which each refer to the delirium caused by drinking 84 although riley rarely published anything controversial some of his poems published from the same period including afterwhiles allude to drug usage and make vague sexual references 85 during the early 1880s riley still made submissions to the elite literary periodicals but continued to be rejected riley found this discouraging but persevered he believed he would never be recognized as a true literary figure until one of the prestigious periodicals published his work 86 lyceum circuit edit riley undertook occasional reading tours around indiana and in august 1880 he was invited to perform at asbury university his performance there so impressed the local phi kappa psi chapter he was invited to join as an honorary member 87 through the fraternity he met robert jones burdette a writer and minister in the indianapolis area burdette was a member of the redpath lyceum bureau of boston a prominent lecture circuit whose regular speakers included ralph waldo emerson 88 burdette encouraged riley to join the circuit through its chicago branch 89 riley s accumulated debt and low income began causing him trouble in 1881 and he decided that rejoining a lecture circuit would provide much needed funds 90 his agreement for continued employment with the circuit depended on his ability to draw audiences during the first season beginning in april 1881 he succeeded drawing the largest crowds in chicago and indianapolis 91 because of his success in the midwest the circuit leaders invited him to make an east coast tour starting in boston at the tremont temple in february 1882 92 riley agreed signing a ten year agreement and granting half his receipts to his agent 93 before his performance he traveled to longfellow s home in massachusetts and convinced him to agree to a meeting their brief meeting was one of riley s fondest memories and he wrote a lengthy article about it after longfellow s death only a month later 94 95 longfellow encouraged riley to focus on poetry and gave him advice for his upcoming performance where riley was well received his poems were greeted with laughter and praised in the city s newspaper reviews 96 97 boston was the literary center of the united states at the time and the impression riley made on the city s literary community finally encouraged prestigious periodicals to publish his work the century magazine was the first to do so running in swimming time in its september 1883 issue 98 until the 1890s it remained the only major literary magazine to publish riley s work knowing the high standards of the magazine riley reserved his best work each year to submit to it including one of his favorites the old man and jim in 1887 99 by the end of 1882 riley s finances began improving dramatically thanks largely to the income from his performances 100 during 1883 he began writing his boone county poems under the pseudonym benjamin f johnson of boone they were almost entirely written in dialect and emphasized topics of rural life during the early nineteenth century often employing nostalgia and the simplicity of country life as elements the old swimmin hole and when the frost is on the punkin were the most popular and helped earn the entire series critical acclaim the topics were popular with readers reminding many of them of their childhood 101 merrill meigs company later renamed bobbs merrill company approached riley to compile the poems into a book riley agreed and his first book was published in august 1883 titled the old swimmin hole and leven more poems the book s popularity necessitated a second printing before the end of the year 102 during this period riley determined that his most popular poems were those on topics of rural life and he began to use that as a common theme throughout his future work 103 the income from his book allowed riley to ease his busy work schedule he submitted articles to the journal less often and made fewer lecture stops he wrote fewer poems but their quality improved he wrote his most famous poems during the mid 1880s including little orphant annie 104 riley attempted to secure a new job at a periodical and leave the journal but the magazines would not hire him unless he was willing to relocate riley was steadfast in his refusal to leave indiana telling reporters that his rural home was his inspiration and to leave would ruin his poetry 105 riley renewed his relationship with bottsford for a third and final time in 1883 the two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers rendezvous he stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable 106 bottsford became convinced riley was seeing another woman however and they ended their relationship in january 1885 107 riley s sister mary had become a close friend of bottsford and scolded him for his mistreatment of her her reputation was tarnished by the affair and she found it difficult to find employment once their relationship was over 108 in 1884 riley toured the major cities in the eastern united states again 109 following the lectures he began compiling a second book of poetry he completed it during july and bowen merrill published it in december with the title the boss girl a christmas story and other sketches 110 the book which contained humorous poetry and short stories received mixed reviews it was popular around indiana where most of its copies were sold one reviewer however called the poems weird nightmarish and eerie and compared them to edgar allan poe s works 111 112 while riley was working on his book he was unexpectedly invited by james b pond the agent for many of the nation s major performers to join a one hundred nights engagement in new york city in a show that included samuel clemens and dudley warner 113 riley was unable to agree with the redpath bureau who had to authorize any other performance under the terms of their contract he believed his contract with the redpath bureau was limiting his opportunities and his relationship with his agent became strained 114 115 western association of writers edit due in part to the limited success of his latest book outside indiana riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to form an association to promote their work popular indiana writer lew wallace author of ben hur was a major promoter of the effort 116 during 1885 more than one hundred writers joined the group they held their first meeting in july naming themselves the western association of writers at the meeting maurice thompson was named president and riley vice president 117 the association never succeeded in its goal of creating a powerful advertising force but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group but came to depend on its regular meetings as an escape from his normally hectic schedule 118 through the association riley became acquainted with most of the notable writers in the midwestern united states including humorist edgar wilson nye of chicago after completing his lecture circuit in 1885 riley formed a partnership with nye and his agent to begin a new tour the redpath bureau agreed to allow riley to tour with nye provided he maintained his financial agreements with them 119 in addition to touring riley and nye collaborated on a book nye and riley s railway guide a collection of humorous anecdotes and poems intended to parody popular tourist literature of the day published in 1888 the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints 99 in october 1887 riley and the association joined with other writers to petition the united states congress to attempt to negotiate international treaties to protect american copyrights abroad the group became known as the international copyright league and had significant success in its efforts when traveling to one of the league s meetings in new york city that year riley was struck by bell s palsy he recovered after three weeks but remained secluded to hide the effects of the sickness which he believed was caused by his alcoholism he made another attempt to stop drinking alcohol with the help of a minister but soon returned to his old habit 120 after recovering riley remained briefly in new york to participate in a show at chickering hall with edgar nye samuel clemens and several others riley was introduced by james russell lowell before his performance and lowell gave riley a glowing endorsement to the crowd his poetry brought both tears and laughter according to the new york sun critic edmund clarence stedman one of the foremost literary critics of the era was present and wrote that riley s dialect poems were the finest he had ever heard in which a homely dramatis sic persona s heart is laid open by subtle indirect absolutely sure and tender poetry 121 as a result of his new york performance his name and picture were carried in all the major eastern papers and he quickly became well known throughout the united states sales of the boss girl increased resulting in the fifth and largest printing and riley finally began to achieve the widespread fame he sought 61 clemens disliked being upstaged by riley and attempted to avoid any future joint performances with him according to one review clemens shriveled up into a bitter patch of melancholy in the fierce light of mr riley s humour 122 after returning home from his tour in early 1888 riley finished compiling his third book titled old fashioned roses arranged to appeal to british readers it included only a few of his dialect poems and consisted mostly of sonnets the book reprinted many poems riley had already published but included some new ones he wrote specifically for the book including the days gone by the little white hearse and the serenade the book was riley s favorite because it included his finest works and was published by the prestigious longmans green publishers with high quality printing and binding 123 124 in late 1888 he finished work on a fourth book pipes o pan at zekesbury which was released to great acclaim in the united states based on a fictional town in indiana riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens and way of life it received mixed reviews from literary critics who wrote of it that riley s stories were not of the same quality as his poetry the book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints 125 126 riley was quickly becoming wealthy from his books and touring earning nearly 20 000 in 1888 he no longer needed his job at the journal and left it near the end of that year the newspaper had served to earn him fame and had published hundreds of his articles stories and poems 127 national fame edit politics edit in march 1888 riley traveled to washington d c where he had dinner at the white house with other members of the international copyright league and president grover cleveland riley gave a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections cleveland was enamored by riley s performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics 128 in the 1888 presidential election campaign riley s acquaintance benjamin harrison was nominated as the republican candidate although riley had shunned politics for most of his life he gave harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund raising events and vote stumping the election was exceptionally partisan in indiana and riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful he vowed never to become involved with politics again 129 upon harrison s election he suggested riley be named the national poet laureate but congress failed to act on the request riley was still honored by harrison and visited him at the white house on several occasions to perform at civic events 130 pay problems and scandal edit riley and nye made arrangements with james pond to do two national tours during 1888 and 1889 131 they were popular and generally sold out with hundreds having to be turned away the shows were usually forty five minutes to an hour long and featured riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from nye the shows were informal and the two men adjusted their performances based on their audiences reactions riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility 130 132 many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows at a new york city show in march 1888 augustin daly was so enthralled by it he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading broadway theater actors 133 despite serving as the act s main draw riley was not permitted to become an equal partner in the venture nye and pond both received a percentage of the net profit while riley was paid a flat rate for each performance 134 in addition because of his past agreements with the redpath lyceum bureau riley was required to pay half of his fee to his agent amos walker this meant the other men profited more than riley from his own work 125 to remedy this situation riley hired his brother in law henry eitel an indianapolis banker to manage his finances and act on his behalf to try to extricate him from his contract despite discussions and assurances from pond that he would work to address the problem eitel had no success pond ultimately made the situation worse by booking months of solid performances not allowing riley and nye a day of rest these events affected riley physically and emotionally he became despondent and began his worst period of alcoholism during november 1889 several shows were cancelled after riley became severely inebriated at a stop in madison wisconsin 135 136 walker began monitoring riley and denying him access to liquor but he found ways to evade him at a stop at the masonic temple theatre in louisville kentucky in january 1890 riley paid the hotel s bartender to sneak whiskey to his room 137 he became too drunk to perform and was unable to travel to the next stop nye terminated their partnership and the tour in response the reason for the breakup could not be kept secret and hotel staff reported to the louisville courier journal they saw riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel 138 the story made national news and riley feared his career was ruined 139 he secretly left louisville at night and returned to indianapolis by train eitel defended him to the press to gain sympathy for riley explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made riley refused to speak to reporters however and hid himself for weeks 140 much to riley s surprise the news reports made him more popular than ever 141 many people thought the stories were exaggerated and riley s carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath but they soon began corresponding with him asking him to resume writing this encouraged riley and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career 142 the negative press did not end however as nye and pond threatened to sue riley for causing their tour to end prematurely they claimed to have lost 20 000 walker threatened a separate suit demanding 1 000 riley hired indianapolis lawyer william p fishback to represent him and the men settled out of court 143 the full details of the settlement were never disclosed but whatever the case riley finally extricated himself from his old contracts and became a free agent the exorbitant amount riley was being sued for only reinforced public opinion that he had been mistreated by his partners and helped him maintain his image nye and riley remained good friends and riley later wrote pond and walker were the source of the problems 144 riley s poetry had become popular in britain in large part due to his book old fashioned roses in may 1891 he traveled to england to tour and made what he considered a literary pilgrimage he landed in liverpool and traveled first to dumfries scotland the home and burial place of robert burns riley had long been compared to burns by critics because they both used dialect in their poetry and drew inspiration from their rural homes 145 146 he then traveled to edinburgh york and london reciting poetry for gatherings at each stop augustin daly arranged for him to give a poetry reading to prominent british actors in london 115 riley was warmly welcomed by its literary and theatrical community and he toured places that shakespeare had frequented 147 riley quickly tired of traveling abroad and began longing for home writing to his nephew that he regretted having left the united states he curtailed his journey and returned to new york city in august 148 149 he spent the next months in his greenfield home attempting to write an epic poem but after several attempts gave up believing he did not possess the ability 150 by 1890 riley had authored almost all his famous poems the few poems he wrote during the 1890s were generally less well received by the public 148 as a solution riley and his publishers began reusing poetry from other books and printing some of his earliest works when neighborly poems was published in 1891 a critic working for the chicago tribune pointed out the use of riley s earliest works commenting that he was using his popularity to push his crude earlier works onto the public only to make money 151 152 riley s newest poems published in the 1894 book armazindy received very negative reviews that referred to poems like the little dog woggy and jargon jingle as drivel and to riley as a worn out genius 151 most of his growing number of critics suggested that he ignored the quality of the poems for the sake of making money 151 last tours edit although riley was wealthy from his books he was able to triple his annual income by touring he found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892 he hired william c glass to assist henry eitel in managing his affairs while eitel handled the finances glass worked to organize his lecture tours 153 glass worked closely with riley s publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation he was careful not to book busy schedules riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short lasting only three months 154 during his 1893 tour riley lectured mostly in the western united states and in his 1894 tour in the east his performances were major events and generally sold out within days of their announcements in 1894 he allowed the author douglass sherley to join his tour sherley was a millionaire who published his own books the literary community had dismissed his work but riley was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance 155 in 1895 riley undertook his last tour making stops in most of the major cities in the united states 156 advertised as his final performances there was incredible demand for tickets and riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour he and sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and nye had done riley often lamented the lack of change in the program he found when he tried to introduce new material or left out any of

closer relationship with eugene debs 160 the same year he began compiling his poems of most interest to children into a new book entitled rhymes of childhood the book was richly illustrated by howard chandler christy and riley wrote a few new poems for the book under the pseudonym uncle sydney 161 rhymes of childhood became riley s best selling book and sold millions of copies it has remained in

books containing his complete life works 169 with the help of his nephew riley began working to compile the books there were eventually sixteen volumes which were finally completed in 1914 such works

plays lively music in honor of the poet weeks before the festival the festival board has a queen contest the pageant has been going on many years in honor of the hoosier poet 198 according to historian elizabeth van allen riley was instrumental in helping form a midwestern cultural identity the midwestern united states had no significant literary community before the 1880s 199 the works of the western association of writers most notably those of riley and wallace helped create the midwest s cultural identity and rival literary community to the established eastern literati for this reason and the publicity riley s work created he was commonly known as the hoosier poet 200 201 critical reception and style edit riley was among the most popular writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century known for his uncomplicated sentimental and humorous writing 202 often writing his verses in dialect his poetry caused readers to recall a nostalgic and simpler time in earlier american history this gave his poetry a unique appeal during a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization in the united states riley was a prolific writer who achieved mass appeal partly due to his canny sense of marketing and publicity 202 he published more than fifty books mostly of poetry and humorous short stories and sold millions of copies 202 he is often remembered for his most famous poems including the raggedy man and little orphant annie many of his poems used events and people from his childhood as an inspiration for their subject matter 202 his poems often contain morals and warnings for children with messages telling children to care for the less fortunate of society david galens and van allen both see these messages as riley s subtle response to the turbulent economic times of the gilded age and the growing progressive movement 203 riley believed that urbanization robbed children of their innocence and sincerity and in his poems he attempted to introduce and idolize characters who had not lost those qualities 204 his children s poems are exuberant performative and often display riley s penchant for using humorous characterization repetition and dialect to make his poetry accessible to a wide ranging audience 202 205 although hinted at indirectly in some poems riley wrote very little on serious subjects and mocked attempts at serious poetry only a few of his sentimental poems concern serious subjects little mandy s christmas tree the absence of little wesley and the happy little cripple are about poverty the death of a child and disabilities like his children s poems they also contain morals suggesting society should pity the downtrodden and be charitable 202 205 riley wrote gentle and romantic poems that were not in dialect they generally consist of sonnets and are strongly influenced by the works of john greenleaf whittier henry wadsworth longfellow and alfred lord tennyson his standard english poetry was never as popular as his hoosier dialect poems 202 still less popular were the poems riley wrote in his later years most were to commemorate important events in american history or to eulogize the dead 202 riley s contemporaries acclaimed him america s best loved poet 202 205 in 1920 henry beers lauded the works of riley as natural and unaffected with none of the discontent and deep thought of cultured song 202 samuel clemens william dean howells and hamlin garland each praised riley s work and the idealism he expressed in his poetry only a few critics of the period found fault with riley s works ambrose bierce criticized riley for his frequent use of dialect he accused riley of using dialect to cover up the faulty construction of his poems 202 edgar lee masters found riley s work to be superficial claiming it lacked irony and that he had only a narrow emotional range 202 by the 1930s popular critical opinion towards riley s works began to shift in favor of the negative reviews in 1951 james t farrell said riley s works were cliched galens wrote modern critics consider riley to be a minor poet whose work provincial sentimental and superficial though it may have been nevertheless struck a chord with a mass audience in a time of enormous cultural change 202 thomas c johnson wrote that what most interests modern critics was riley s ability to market his work saying he had a unique understanding of how to commodify his own image and the nostalgic dreams of an anxious nation 202 among the earliest widespread criticisms of riley were opinions that his dialect writing did not actually represent the true dialect of central indiana in 1970 peter revell wrote riley s dialect was more like the poor speech of a child rather than the dialect of his region he made extensive comparisons to historical texts and riley s dialect usage philip greasley wrote that while some critics have dismissed him as sub literary insincere and an artificial entertainer his defenders reply that an author so popular with millions of people in different walks of life must contribute something of value and that his faults if any can be ignored 205 see also edit notes edit

        "biblical matriarch leah a appears in the hebrew bible as one of the two wives of the biblical patriarch jacob leah was jacob s first wife and the older sister of his second and favored wife

cow a common title with ancient goddesses like inana urash and nanshe 4 rachel means ewe lamb noegel says there s an irony involving laban s flocks within this detail one is on generative acts give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go into her \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4 29 21 herein also lies a subtle pun on leah s name which occurs again in 29 23 5 biblical narrative edit overview edit leah first appears in the book of genesis in genesis 29 which describes her as the daughter of laban and the older sister of rachel and is said to not compare to rachel s physical beauty and that she has tender eyes b earlier passages in the book of genesis give some background on her father s family noting that through him she is the niece of rebecca who is the wife of isaac and the mother of jacob and esau and the granddaughter of bethuel and rabbinic literature goes even further with the book of jasher claiming leah and rachel were twins and recording her mother s name as adinah and her brothers names as beor alub and murash rabbinical literature contradicts itself on whether leah and rachel were half siblings to zilpah and bilhah two sisters who would serve as mistresses to leah s future husband jacob and whose children she and rachel would raise as their own as one source which lists them as being daughters of laban but not his wife adinah and another lists them as being the daughters of rotheus a man who was close to laban but not related to him if zilpah and bilhah were indeed half sisters of leah this would make leah s adoptive sons gad and asher and rachel s adoptive sons dan and naphtali her nephews according to genesis 28 2 7 the family resided in paddan aram an area believed to correspond with the historical upper mesopotamia 8 prior to her and rachel s mentioning the book of genesis details how their first cousin and future husband jacob with the help of his mother rebecca willfully deceives his dying father isaac into giving him his twin brother esau s birthright fearful of his brother s wrath jacob flees his homeland for haran where he meets his maternal family including laban and his daughters biblical passages are dismissive of leah and favorable of rachel with rachel said to be beautiful and of leah only that she had weary tired or tender eyes b jacob is eager to marry rachel and agrees to provide seven years labor to her father if he can marry her laban initially agrees but on the night of what would ve been jacob and rachel s wedding laban reneges he insists jacob marry leah instead as she is older jacob is ultimately allowed to marry rachel which he does immediately after the festivities related to his wedding to leah end in exchange for another seven years labor leah s life as jacob s wife was distressful so lonely was she that even the lord took notice of it and blessed her with many children as consolation due to the extreme emotional distress suffered by both leah and rachel during the marriage yahweh later strictly clarified his opposition to uncovering the nakedness of a woman and her sister while both were still living genesis 30 1 leviticus 18 18 despite rachel s infertility jacob still favored rachel over her he also favored rachel s sons joseph and benjamin over leah s and made no attempts to hide that from her or his other children according to 1 chronicles 5 1 9 jacob took the firstborn s birthright which entitles a firstborn to a larger inheritance in jewish law from reuben his oldest son to joseph who was his second youngest son and in genesis 33 2 10 when he is confronted by esau puts leah along with zilpah and bilhah and all of their sons in front of himself rachel and joseph to be used as something of a buffer or a shield to protect himself in the event the confrontation turned violent appearance edit the torah introduces leah by describing her with the phrase leah had tender eyes biblical hebrew \u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4 \u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea genesis 29 17 11 it is argued as to whether the adjective tender \u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea should be taken to mean delicate and soft or rather weary 12 or weak 13 the commentary of rashi cites a rabbinic interpretation of how leah s eyes became weak according to this story leah was destined to marry jacob s older twin brother esau in the rabbinic mind the two brothers are polar opposites jacob being a god fearing scholar and esau being a hunter who also indulges in idolatry and adultery but people were saying laban has two daughters and his sister rebekah has two sons the older daughter leah will marry the older son esau and the younger daughter rachel will marry the younger son jacob 14 hearing this leah spent most of her time weeping and praying to god to change her destined mate thus the torah describes her eyes as soft from weeping god hearkens to leah s tears and prayers and allows her to marry jacob even before rachel does marriage to jacob edit leah becomes jacob s wife through a deception on the part of her father laban in the biblical account jacob is dispatched to the hometown of laban the brother of his mother rebekah to avoid being killed by his brother esau and to find a wife out by the well he encounters laban s younger daughter rachel tending her father s sheep and decides to marry her laban is willing to give rachel s hand to jacob as long as he works seven years for her on the wedding night however laban switches leah for rachel later laban claims that it is uncustomary to give the younger daughter away in marriage before the older one genesis 29 16 30 15 laban offers to give rachel to jacob in marriage in return for another seven years of work genesis 29 27 16 jacob accepts the offer and marries rachel after the week long celebration of his marriage to leah dante s vision of rachel and leah dante gabriel rossetti 1855 tomb of leah 1911 motherhood edit leah was the mother of six of jacob s sons including his first four reuben simeon levi and judah and later two more issachar and zebulun and a daughter dinah according to the scriptures god saw that leah was unloved and opened her womb as consolation through her sons levi and judah she is thus the matriarch of both the priestly levite and royal judahite tribes in israel seeing that she was unable to conceive rachel offered her handmaid bilhah to jacob and named and raised the two sons dan and naphtali that bilhah gave birth to leah responded by offering her handmaid zilpah to jacob and named and raised the two sons gad and asher that zilpah gave birth to according to some commentaries bilhah and zilpah are actually half sisters of leah and rachel 17 one day leah s firstborn son reuben returned from the field with mandrakes for his mother leah had not conceived for a while and the plant whose roots resemble the human body was thought to be an aid to fertility 18 frustrated that she was not able to conceive at all rachel offered to trade her night with their husband with leah in return for the mandrakes leah agreed and that night she slept with jacob and conceived issachar afterwards she gave birth to zebulun and to a daughter dinah 19 after that god remembered rachel and gave her two sons joseph and benjamin rivalry with rachel edit on a homiletical level the classic chassidic texts explain the sisters rivalry as more than marital jealousy each woman desired to grow spiritually in her avodat hashem service of god and therefore sought closeness to the tzadik jacob who is god s personal emissary in this world by marrying jacob and bearing his sons who would be raised in the tzadik s home and continue his mission into the next generation indeed all 12 sons became tzadikim in their own right and formed the foundation of the nation of israel they would develop an even closer relationship to god therefore leah and rachel each wanted to have as many of those sons as possible going so far as to offer their handmaids as proxies to jacob so they could have a share in the upbringing of their handmaids sons too 20 each woman also continually questioned whether she was doing enough in her personal efforts toward increased spirituality and would use the other s example to spur herself on rachel envied leah s tearful prayers by which she merited to marry the tzaddik and bear six of his twelve sons 17 20 the talmud megillah 13b says that rachel revealed to leah the secret signs which she and jacob had devised to identify the veiled bride because they both suspected laban would pull such a trick 21 death and burial edit leah died some time before jacob according to genesis 49 31 22 she is thought to be buried in the cave of the patriarchs in hebron alongside jacob this cave also houses the graves of abraham and sarah and isaac and rebekah 23 medieval christian symbolism edit in medieval christian symbolism rachel was taken as a symbol of the contemplative monastic christian life and leah as a symbol of the active non monastic life 24 dante alighieri s purgatorio includes a dream of rachel and leah which inspired illustrations by dante gabriel rossetti and others in my dream i seemed to see a woman both young and fair along a plain she gathered flowers and even as she sang she said whoever asks my name know that i m leah and i apply my lovely hands to fashion a garland of the flowers i have gathered 25 notes edit references edit",

        "biblical character sarah a originally sarai b is a biblical matriarch prophet and major figure in abrahamic religions while different abrahamic faiths portray her differently judaism christianity and islam all depict her character similarly as that of a pious woman renowned for her hospitality and beauty the wife of abraham and the mother of isaac sarah has her feast day on 1 september in the catholic church 1 19 august in the coptic orthodox church 2 20 january in the lcms 3 and 12 and 20 december in the eastern orthodox church 4 in the hebrew bible edit a depiction of sarah and abraham family edit according to book of genesis 20 12 in conversation with the philistine king abimelech of gerar abraham describes sarah as both his wife and his half sister my father s daughter but not my mother s 5 such unions were later explicitly banned in the book of leviticus leviticus 18 9 however some commentators identify her as iscah genesis 11 29 a daughter of abraham s brother haran 6 7 by her union with abraham sarah had one child isaac 8 after her death abraham married keturah whose identity biblical scholars debate that is whether or not she was actually hagar and by her had at least six more children narrative edit in the biblical narrative sarah is the wife of abraham in two places in the narrative he says sarah is his sister genesis 12 10 through 13 1 in the encounter with pharaoh and genesis 20 in the encounter with abimelech knowing sarah to be a great beauty and fearing that the pharaoh would kill abraham to be with sarah abraham asks sarah to tell the pharaoh that she is his sister genesis 17 she was originally called sarai in the narrative of the covenant of the pieces in genesis 17 during which yahweh promises abram that he and sarai will have a son abram is renamed as abraham and sarai is renamed as sarah according to most modern scholars both sarah and sarai come from the same root srr with both meaning important woman 9 a minority of scholars derive sarai from the root sry meaning contend with or withstand similar to the name israel 9 departure from ur edit terah with abram as he was then called sarai and lot departed for canaan but stopped in a place named haran where terah remained until he died at the age of 205 10 yahweh had told abram to leave his country and his father s house for a land that he would show him promising to make of him a great nation bless him make his name great bless those who blessed him and curse him that curses him 11 following god s command abram took his wife sarai his nephew lot and the wealth and slaves that they had acquired and traveled to shechem in canaan abram was 75 at this time 12 pharaoh edit sarai is taken to pharaoh s palace by james tissot there was a severe famine in the land of canaan so abram and lot and their households travelled south to egypt on the journey to egypt abram instructed sarai to identify herself only as his sister fearing that the egyptians would kill him in order to take his wife saying i know what a beautiful woman you are when the egyptians see you they will say this is his wife then they will kill me but will let you live say you are my sister so that i will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you 13 when brought before pharaoh sarai said that abram was her brother and the king thereupon took her into his palace and bestowed upon abram many presents and marks of distinction however god afflicted pharaoh s household with great plagues 14 pharaoh then realized that sarai was abram s wife and demanded that they leave egypt immediately 15 hagar and ishmael edit banishment of hagar etching \u00e0 paris chez fr fanet \u00e9diteur rue des saints p\u00e8res n 10 18th century sarah is seen at the left looking on after having lived in canaan for ten years and still childless sarai suggested that abram have a child with her egyptian handmaiden hagar to which he agreed this resulted in tension between sarai and hagar and sarai complained to her husband that the handmaid no longer respected her 16 at one point hagar fled from her mistress but returned after angels consoled her she gave birth to abram s son ishmael when abram was eighty six years old 17 isaac edit in genesis 17 when abram was ninety nine years old god declared his new name abraham a father of many nations and gave him the covenant of circumcision god gave sarai the new name sarah and blessed her 18 abraham was given assurance that sarah would have a son not long afterwards abraham and sarah were visited by three men one of the visitors told abraham that upon his return next year sarah would have a son while at the tent entrance sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages the visitor inquired of abraham why sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child for her age was as nothing to god sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to abraham at the very time which had been spoken the patriarch then a hundred years old named the child isaac hebrew yitschaq laughter and circumcised him when he was eight days old 19 for sarah the thought of giving birth and nursing a child at such an old age also brought her much laughter as she declared god had made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me 20 abraham held a great feast on the day when isaac was to be weaned it was during this banquet that sarah happened upon the then teenaged ishmael mocking isaac 21 and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and hagar be banished 22 abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by god to do as his wife had asked 23 abimelech edit after being visited by the three men abraham and sarah settled between kadesh and shur in the land of the philistines while he was living in gerar abraham again claimed that sarah was his sister king abimelech subsequently had her brought to him later god came to abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman abimelech who had not laid hands on her inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation especially since abraham had claimed that he and sarah were siblings in response god told abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that was why he continued to exist however if he did not return sarah to abraham god would surely destroy abimelech and his entire household abimelech was informed that abraham was a prophet who would pray for him 24 early the next morning abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom abraham replied that he thought there was no fear of god in that place and that they might kill him for his wife then abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife 25 abimelech returned sarah to abraham and gave him gifts of sheep oxen and servants and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in abimelech s lands further abimelech gave abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as sarah s vindication before all abraham then prayed for abimelech and his household since god had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of sarah 26 death edit sarah dies at the age of 127 and abraham buys a piece of land with a cave near hebron from ephron the hittite in which to bury her which is the first land owned by the israelites in canaan according to the biblical narrative the place became known as the cave of the patriarchs 27 28 26 later hebrew bible references edit sarah is mentioned alongside abraham in isaiah 51 2 look to abraham your father and to sarah who bore you new testament references edit the first epistle of peter praises sarah for obeying her husband 29 she is praised for her faith in the hebrews hall of faith passage alongside a number of other old testament figures 30 other new testament references to sarah are in romans 31 and galatians 32 in galatians 4 she and hagar are used as an allegory of the old and new covenants for it is written that abraham had two sons one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman his son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise these things may be taken figuratively for the women represent two covenants one covenant is from mount sinai and bears children who are to be slaves this is hagar now hagar stands for mount sinai and corresponds to the present city of jerusalem because she is in slavery with her children but the jerusalem that is above is free and she is our mother now you brothers like isaac are children of promise therefore brothers we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman 33 historicity edit in the early and middle 20th century leading archaeologists such as william foxwell albright and biblical scholars such as albrecht alt believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the patriarchal age the 2nd millennium bce but in the 1970s new arguments concerning israel s past and the biblical texts challenged these views these arguments can be found in thomas l thompson s the historicity of the patriarchal narratives 1974 and john van seters abraham in history and tradition 1975 thompson a literary scholar based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts his thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium bce and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns van seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names social milieu and messages strongly suggested that they were iron age creations 34 18 19 by the beginning of the 21st century archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make the patriarchs and matriarchs credible historical figures 35 36 98 and fn 2 religious views edit in judaism edit sarah first appears in the book of genesis while the midrash and aggadah provide some additional commentary on her life and role within judaism and its ancestral form yahwism she is born sarai hebrew \u05e9 \u05e8 \u05d9 in ur ka\u015bdim or ur of the chaldees believed to have been in present day iraq 1 958 anno mundi according to the hebrew calendar she was the daughter of haran 37 and the granddaughter of terah an idolater who worshiped the moon god nanna 38 and high ranking servant of nimrod citation needed the king of shinar or mesopotamia but not of his wife amathlai her name is a feminine form of sar hebrew \u05e9 \u05e8 meaning chieftain or prince citation needed through terah she would have been a 10th generation descendant of noah still alive citation needed living in the mountains of ararat and over nine centuries old at the time of her birth no details are given as to her life or her religious beliefs before abraham s return to ur ka\u015bdim to thwart nimrod s efforts to proclaim himself a god it is known she wed abraham then called abram sometime between the ages of forty and five and following her husband s public humiliation of nimrod she along with her father terah her orphaned nephew lot her manservant eliezer and some three hundred others left ur ka\u015bdim for canaan the present day levant to save abraham from a plot by nimrod to destroy him commanded to do so by yahweh citation needed en route to canaan the group stopped in harran in present day turkey settling there for some twenty years until yahweh urged them to move on and so they left terah behind to live out his days and traveled through shechem and bethel both cities in the present day west bank and when a famine strikes the region to mizraim present day egypt while in mizraim sarah s beauty attracts the attention of pharaoh and abraham fearing the egyptians would kill him if they knew sarah was married to him introduces himself as her brother and so pharaoh bestows upon abraham great wealth in the form of livestock and slaves including hagar so that he may take sarah as his concubine to live in his palace with him citation needed for pharaoh s unintentional transgression against abraham he and members of his household save for sarah are stricken with plague pharaoh then realizes that abraham is sarah s husband not only her brother despite abraham s willful deceit of pharaoh pharaoh does not punish abraham nor does he require the return of the wealth abram was given in exchange for sarah however he orders them to leave mizraim after leaving mizraim lot splits from their group amicably he eventually settles in sodom over disputes related to the livestock they returned to canaan and a decade passed and still she and abraham had no children thus sarah offered hagar her slavewoman as a concubine to her husband so that he may have a child hagar became pregnant with ishmael during hagar s pregnancy sarah and hagar s relationship deteriorated rapidly with sarah striking her and hagar fleeing into the desert to avoid her returning only at the urging of angels yahweh then told abraham that sarah would give him a son sarah then ninety years old laughed at this idea but as prophesied she became pregnant with isaac and she nursed him herself she would ultimately demand that abraham send hagar and ishmael away and so abraham banished them and sent them into the desert sometime after the birth of ishmael but before the birth of isaac sarah and abraham travel to gerar as described in genesis 20 where events took place which mirrored those of mizraim in which a king this time abimelech took an interest in sarah for her beauty and as he had done in mizraim abraham presented himself as her brother instead of her husband and so believing her unmarried abimelech took her into her house as pharaoh had though this time yahweh intervened before he touched sarah through dreams and plague abimelech confronted abraham angry that his lie had caused him to provoke the wrath of a god but also like pharaoh he bestows great wealth upon abraham the two men part amicably with abraham saying he will pray for the king who is childless and without an heir it is said that sarah died at the age of one hundred and twenty seven years caused in part by the events of the binding of isaac she is buried in kiryat arba in hebron in the cave of machpela in rabbinic literature edit the talmud identifies sarai with iscah daughter of abraham s deceased brother haran 39 so that in this sarah turns out to be the niece of abraham and the sister of lot and milcah 40 while in genesis 20 12 abraham claims that sarah is indeed my sister my father s daughter rather than his niece rashi asserts that the term daughter can also be used regarding a granddaughter and thus sister can be used regarding a niece 41 the fifth century rabbinic midrash genesis rabbah dedicates a large amount of attention to sarah in particular 42 not only are a relatively large number of drashot dedicated to the matriarch but she is repeatedly depicted as a model of personal and religious excellence this is marked break from the biblical and second temple literature in which she plays a far more ancillary role in light of parallels between the rabbis characterization of sarah and early christian themes connected to the virgin mary popular in this same period it has been suggested that the rabbis used their portrayal of sarah to establish her as a jewish alternative to the virgin mary when brought before pharaoh sarah said that abram was her brother and the king thereupon bestowed upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction 43 as a token of his love for sarai the king deeded his entire property to her and gave her the land of goshen as her hereditary possession for this reason the israelites subsequently lived in that land 44 sarai prayed to god to deliver her from the king and he thereupon sent an angel who struck pharaoh whenever he attempted to touch her pharaoh was so astonished at these blows that he spoke kindly to sarai who confessed that she was abraham s wife the king then ceased to annoy her 43 according to another version pharaoh persisted in annoying her after she had told him that she was a married woman thereupon the angel struck him so violently that he became ill and was thereby prevented from continuing to trouble her 45 according to one tradition it was when pharaoh saw these miracles wrought in sarai s behalf that he gave her his daughter hagar as slave saying it is better that my daughter should be a slave in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house abimelech acted likewise 46 in genesis 17 15 god changes her name to sarah princess a woman of high rank as part of the covenant with el shaddai after hagar bears abram his first born son ishmael abraham sarah and hagar imagined here in a bible illustration from 1897 sarai treated hagar well and induced women who came to visit her to visit hagar also hagar when pregnant by abraham began to act superciliously toward sarai provoking the latter to treat her harshly to impose heavy work upon her and even to strike her 47 some believe sarai was originally destined to reach the age of 175 years but forty eight years of this span of life were taken away from her because she complained of abraham blaming him as though he was the cause that hagar no longer respected her 48 49 sarah was sterile but a miracle was granted to her 50 after her name was changed from sarai to sarah 48 according to one myth when her fertility had been restored and she had given birth to isaac the people would not believe in the miracle saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son abraham thereupon invited all the notabilities to a banquet on the day when isaac was to be weaned sarah invited the women also who brought their infants with them and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the strange children thus convincing the guests of the miracle 51 legends connect sarah s death with the attempted sacrifice of isaac 52 however there are two versions of the story according to one samael came to her and said your old husband seized the boy and sacrificed him the boy wailed and wept but he could not escape from his father sarah began to cry bitterly and ultimately died of her grief 53 according to the other legend satan came to sarah disguised as an old man and told her that isaac had been sacrificed believing it to be true she cried bitterly but soon comforted herself with the thought that the sacrifice had been offered at the command of god she started from beer sheba to hebron asking everyone she met if he knew in which direction abraham had gone then satan came again in human shape and told her that it was not true that isaac had been sacrificed but that he was living and would soon return with his father sarah on hearing this died of joy at hebron abraham and isaac returned to their home at beer sheba and not finding sarah there went to hebron where they discovered her dead 54 according to the genesis rabbah during sarah s lifetime her house was always hospitably open the dough was miraculously increased a light burned from friday evening to saturday evening and a pillar of cloud rested upon the entrance to her tent 55 in islam edit the islamic portrayal of sarah who is unnamed in the quran mimics that of her portrayal in judaism and christianity in that she is a good woman kin and wife to abraham who after years of barrenness has a son the prophet isaac is\u1e25\u0101q however notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with abraham hagar and ishmael she is not portrayed as abraham s sister but his first cousin said to be the daughter of terah s brother haran and hagar is not portrayed as abraham s mistress but a second wife eliminating the hostility that sarah feels for hagar during her pregnancy and toward ishmael 56 57 58 mausoleum of sarah abraham s wife in the mosque of abraham the quran likewise repeats the biblical story that sarah laughed when she received a divine message confirming her pregnancy although in the quran this message is heralded by angels and not by god himself 59 11 69 and surely our messenger angels came to abraham with good news of a son they greeted him with peace and he replied peace be upon you then it was not long before he brought them a fat roasted calf 11 70 and when he saw that their hands did not reach for the food he became suspicious and fearful of them they reassured him do not be afraid we are angels sent only against the people of lot 11 71 and his wife was standing by so she laughed then we gave her good news of the birth of isaac and after him jacob 11 72 she wondered oh my how can i have a child in this old age and my husband here is an old man this is truly an astonishing thing tomb of sarah edit mausoleum of sarah 1911 sarah is believed to be buried in the cave of the patriarchs known by muslims as the sanctuary of abraham the compound located in the ancient city of hebron is the second holiest site for jews after the temple mount in jerusalem and is also venerated by christians and muslims both of whom have traditions which maintain that the site is the burial place of three biblical couples abraham and sarah isaac and rebecca and jacob and leah 60 relationship to abraham edit there are three stories in genesis where a patriarch identifies his wife as his sister scholars debate the relationship among these with some saying that the account of the encounter of abraham and sarah with pharaoh in genesis 12 13 is the oldest while the stories of abraham and sarah encounter king abimelech in genesis 20 and of isaac and rebecca s encounter with a different king abimelech in genesis 26 are interpretations of that one generated to explain it or deal with other matters of concern it is not clear which of the stories is actually older or what the intent of the editors of the bible may have been 61 according to emanuel feldman 1965 basing his argument on albright s interpretation of the archaeology of nuzu a wife could legally be awarded the title sister and that this was the most sacred form of marriage and hence abraham and isaac referred to their wives as sisters for this reason citation needed most archaeologists who however dispute that view instead arguing the opposite that sisters in the region were often awarded the title wife in order to give them much greater status in society 62 savina teubal s book sarah the priestess posits that while sarah was indeed both abram s wife and sister there was no incest taboo because she was a half sister by a different mother 63 in popular

        "biblical character rebecca a appears in the hebrew bible as the wife of isaac and the mother of jacob and esau according to biblical tradition rebecca s father was bethuel the aramean from paddan aram also called aram naharaim 3 rebecca s brother was laban the aramean and she was the granddaughter of milcah and nahor the brother of abraham 4 rebecca and isaac were one of the four couples that some believe are buried in the cave of the patriarchs the other three being adam and eve abraham and sarah and jacob and leah 5 most scholars have considered rebecca s historicity uncertain 6 early life edit abram s servant meeteth rebecca 1896 1902 by james tissot after the binding of isaac sarah died after taking care of her burial abraham went about finding a wife for his son isaac who was already 37 years old he commanded his servant whom the torah commentators identify as eliezer of damascus 7 to journey to aram naharaim to select a bride from his own family rather than engage isaac to a local canaanite girl abraham sent along expensive jewelry clothing and dainties as gifts to the bride and her family if the girl had refused to follow him abraham stated that eliezer would be absolved of his responsibility the servant devised a test in order to find the right wife for isaac as he stood at the central well in aram naharaim the city of nahor with his men and ten camels laden with goods he prayed to god let the maiden to whom i say please lower your jar that i may drink and who replies drink and i will also water your camels let her be the one whom you have decreed for your servant isaac thereby shall i know that you have dealt graciously with my master genesis 24 14 to his surprise a young girl immediately came out and offered to draw water for him to drink as well as water to fill the troughs for all his camels rebecca continued to draw water until all the camels were sated proving her kind and generous nature and her suitability for entering abraham s household the servant immediately gave her a golden nose ring and two golden bracelets genesis 24 22 genesis 24 47 which rebecca hurried to show her mother seeing the jewelry rebecca s brother laban ran out to greet the guest and bring him inside the servant recounted the oath he made to abraham and all the details of his trip to and meeting with rebecca in fine detail after which her brother laban and her father bethuel agreed that she could return with him after hosting the party overnight the family tried to keep rebecca with them longer the servant insisted that they ask the girl herself and she agreed to go immediately her family sent her off with her nurse deborah according to rashi and blessed her our sister may you come to be thousands of myriads and may your offspring inherit the gate of its foes as rebecca and her entourage approached abraham s home they spied isaac from a distance in the fields of beer lahai roi the talmud 8 and the midrash explain that isaac was praying as he instituted mincha the afternoon prayer seeing such a spiritually exalted man rebecca immediately dismounted from her camel and asked the accompanying servant who he was when she heard that this was her future husband she modestly covered herself with a veil isaac brought her into the tent of his deceased mother sarah married her and loved her according to rashi the three miracles that characterized sarah s tent while she was alive and that disappeared with her death reappeared when rebecca entered the tent these were a lamp burned in her tent from shabbat eve to shabbat eve there was a blessing in her dough and a cloud hovered over her tent symbolizing the divine presence wedding allusions edit some of the events leading up to the marriage of isaac and rebecca have been institutionalized in the traditional jewish wedding ceremony before the bride and bridegroom stand under the chuppah they take part in a special ceremony called badeken veiling the bridegroom is led to the bride by two escorts and seeing her covers her face with a veil like the way rebecca covered her face before marrying isaac then the bridegroom or the father of the bride or the officiating rabbi recites the same blessing over the bride that rebecca s family recited over her our sister may you come to be thousands of myriads and may your offspring inherit the gate of its foes 9 marriage and motherhood edit rebecca meets isaac by the way by james tissot c 1896 1902 according to the traditional counting cited by rashi isaac was 37 years old at the time of the binding of isaac the reasoning for that age is that sarah who gave birth to isaac when she was 90 died after the binding when she was 127 years old making isaac around 37 at that time 10 according to seder olam rabbah and targum pseudo jonathan rebecca was 3 at the time of her marriage a number which is accepted by most medieval rabbinical commentators including rashi 11 12 13 however isaiah di trani and hezekiah ben manoah calculate that she was 14 11 14 twenty years elapsed before they had children throughout that time both isaac and rebecca prayed fervently to god for offspring god eventually answered isaac s prayers and rebecca conceived 15 rebecca was extremely uncomfortable during her pregnancy and went to inquire of god why she was suffering so according to the midrash whenever she would pass a house of torah study jacob would struggle to come out whenever she would pass a house of idolatry esau would agitate to come out 16 thinking that she was carrying one baby who was displaying conflicting propensities rebecca sought enlightenment at the yeshiva of shem and eber there she received the prophecy that twins were fighting in her womb and would continue to fight all their lives 17 the prophecy also said that the older would serve the younger its statement one people will be stronger than the other has been taken to mean that the two nations will never gain power simultaneously when one falls the other will rise and vice versa 18 according to tradition rebecca did not share the prophecy with her husband when the time came for rebecca to give birth the first child to come out emerged red and hairy all over with his heel grasped by the hand of the second to come out onlookers named the first \u05e2\u05e9\u05d5 esau esav or esaw meaning either rough sensibly felt handled from hebrew \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 asah do or make 19 or completely developed from hebrew \u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05d9 assui since esau had as much hair as a child who was much older 20 the second was named \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 jacob ya aqob or ya aqov meaning heel catcher supplanter leg puller he who follows upon the heels of one from hebrew \u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 aqab or aqav seize by the heel circumvent restrain a wordplay upon hebrew \u05e2\u05e7\u05d1\u05d4 iqqebah or iqqbah heel 21 the bible states that isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born 22 the midrash says that as boys people did not notice much difference between them when they reached the age of 13 jacob busied himself in the house of study while esau busied himself with idolatry 23 the descriptions of the two young men hint at their opposing spiritual natures the lads grew up and esau became one who knows hunting a man of the field but jacob was a wholesome man abiding in tents 24 the description of esau as a hunter hints to his skill of trapping his father with his mouth for example he would ask isaac whether tithes should be taken from salt and straw making his father think he was scrupulous in keeping the mitzvot 25 scripture notes that the attitudes of their parents toward the boys differed isaac loved esau because he did eat of hunting but rebecca loved jacob 26 according to the talmud immediately after abraham died jacob prepared a lentil stew as a traditional mourner s meal for his father isaac 27 the hebrew bible states that esau returning famished from the fields begged jacob to give him some of the stew esau referred to the dish as that red red stuff giving rise to his nickname hebrew \u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05dd edom meaning red jacob offered to give esau a bowl of stew in exchange for his birthright the right to be recognized as firstborn and esau agreed the talmudic dating indicates both men were 15 years old at the time 28 at a later time a famine struck the land of israel and isaac moved his family upon god s command to gerar which was ruled by abimelech king of the philistines like abraham before him who called sarah his sister rather than his wife so that the egyptians would not kill him and take his wife isaac told the people of gerar that rebecca was his sister she was not molested but one day abimelech looked through the window and saw isaac sporting a euphemism for sexual play 29 with her abimelech called isaac on his lie and then warned others not to touch rebecca eventually isaac parted from abimelech in peace at the age of 40 the same age his father had been when he married esau took two hittite wives judith the daughter of beeri and basemath the daughter of elon who vexed isaac and rebecca to no end as these women were also idol worshippers one reason why isaac became blind in his old age was due to the smoke of the incense that these women offered to their idols 30 deception of isaac edit isaac became blind in his old age and decided to bestow the blessing of the firstborn upon esau according to the midrash isaac had reached the age of 132 five years past the age of his mother sarah had been at the time of her death according to genesis isaac had reached the age of 137 at this time the sages state that one should begin to think he might not exceed the age of whichever parent died first 31 isaac therefore sent esau out to the fields to trap and cook a piece of game for him so that he could eat it and bless esau before he died rebecca overheard this conversation and realized that isaac s blessings should go to jacob since she was told before the twins birth that the older son would serve the younger 31 she therefore ordered jacob to bring her two goats from the flock which she cooked in the way isaac loved and had him bring them to his father in place of esau when jacob protested that his father would recognize the deception and curse him as soon as he felt him since esau was hairy and jacob smooth skinned rebecca said that the curse would be on her instead before she sent jacob to his father she dressed him in esau s garments and laid goatskins on his arms and neck to simulate hairy skin thus disguised jacob entered his father s room surprised to perceive that esau was back so soon isaac asked how it could be that the hunt went so quickly jacob responded because the lord your god arranged it for me rashi on genesis 52 46 says isaac s suspicions were aroused because esau never used the personal name of god isaac demanded that jacob come close so he could feel him but the goatskins felt just like esau s hairy skin confused isaac exclaimed the voice is the voice of jacob but the hands are the hands of esau 27 22 still trying to get at the truth isaac asked him point blank are you really my son esau and jacob answered simply i am which can be taken as i am me not i am esau isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that jacob gave him and then he blessed him with the dew of the heavens the fatness of the earth and rulership over many nations as well as his own brother jacob had scarcely left the room when esau returned from the hunt to receive the blessing the realization that he has been deceived shocks isaac yet he acknowledged that jacob received the blessings as sworn by adding indeed he will be or remain blessed 52 8 rashi explains that isaac smelled the heavenly scent of gan eden paradise when jacob entered his room as a contrast isaac perceived gehenna opening beneath esau when the latter entered the room showing isaac that he had been deceived all along by esau s show of piety 32 esau was heartbroken by the deception and begged for his own blessing having made jacob a ruler over his brothers isaac could only promise by thy sword thou shalt live and shalt serve thy brother yet it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt cast off his yoke from off thy neck gen 27 40 esau was filled with hatred toward jacob for taking away both his birthright and his blessing he vowed to himself to kill jacob as soon as isaac died here again rebecca prophetically perceived his murderous intentions and ordered jacob to travel to her brother laban s house in haran until esau s anger subsided she then convinced isaac to send jacob away by telling him that she despaired of him marrying a local girl from the idol worshipping families of canaan as esau had done after isaac sent jacob away to find a wife esau realized that his own canaanite wives were evil in his father s eyes esau therefore took mahalath a daughter of isaac s half brother ishmael as another wife death and burial edit grave of rebecca in hebron jacob lived with laban for twenty years gen 31 41 marrying laban s two daughters and two maidservants he returned to canaan with his large family servants and possessions as he did deborah rebecca s nurse died and was buried at a place that jacob calls alon bachuth \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05df \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05ea tree of weepings gen 35 8 according to the midrash 33 the plural form of the word weeping indicates a double sorrow implying that rebecca also died at this time rebecca was buried in the cave of machpelah near mamre in the land of canaan gen 49 31 according to the talmud the torah s explicit dating of the life of ishmael helps to date various events in jacob s life and by implication the age of rebecca at her death ishmael was born when abraham was 86 years old gen 16 16 and died at the age of 137 gen 25 17 isaac was born when abraham was 100 gen 21 5 at that time ishmael was 14 jacob and esau were born when isaac was 60 gen 25 26 at that time ishmael was 74 right after jacob receives the blessings and flees to laban the torah states that esau married mahalat the daughter of ishmael son of abraham sister of nebaiot gen 28 9 on which rashi quoting megillah 17a notes that ishmael died between the engagement and wedding so the girl s brother gave her away if ishmael was 137 at the time of his death this means that jacob and esau were 63 at the time of the blessings the talmud adds that jacob spent 14 years in the yeshiva of shem and eber before proceeding to laban arriving when he was 77 rebecca s death after jacob s 20 years with laban indicates that jacob was 97 when his mother died and rebecca was either 120 or 134 based on different midrashim mentioned earlier about her age at marriage gallery edit see also edit explanatory notes edit",

known evidence of bread making at a 14 500 year old natufian site in jordan s northeastern desert 21 during the neolithic period 10 000 4 500 bc there was a transition there from a hunter gatherer culture to a culture with established populous agricultural villages 22 ain ghazal one such village located at a site in the eastern part of present day amman is one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in the near east 23 dozens of plaster statues of the human form dating to 7250 bc or earlier have been uncovered there they are one of the oldest large scale representations of humans ever found 24 during the chalcolithic period 4500 3600 bc several villages emerged in transjordan including tulaylet ghassul in the jordan valley 25 a series of circular stone enclosures in the eastern basalt desert from the same period have long baffled archaeologists 26 the mesha stele c 840 bc records the glory of mesha king of moab displayed at the louvre museum fortified towns and urban centres first emerged in the southern levant early in the bronze age 3600 1200 bc 27 wadi feynan became a regional centre for copper extraction the metal was exploited on a large scale to produce bronze 28 trade and movement of people in the middle east peaked causing cultural innovations and whole civilisations to spread 29 villages in transjordan expanded rapidly in areas with reliable water resources and arable land 29 ancient egyptian populations expanded towards the levant and came to control both banks of the jordan river 30 during the iron age 1200 332 bc after the withdrawal of the egyptians transjordan was home to the kingdoms of ammon edom and moab 31 these peoples spoke semitic languages of the canaanite group archaeologists have concluded that their polities were tribal kingdoms rather than states 31 ammon was located in the amman plateau moab in the highlands east of the dead sea and edom in the area around wadi araba in the south 31 the northwestern region of the transjordan known then as gilead was settled by the israelites 32 the three kingdoms continually clashed with the neighbouring hebrew kingdoms of israel and judah centred west of the jordan river 33 one record of this is the mesha stele erected by the moabite king mesha in 840 bc in an inscription on it he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in moab and commemorates his glory and his victory against the israelites 34 the stele constitutes one of the most important archeological parallels to accounts recorded in the bible 35 at the same time israel and the kingdom of aram damascus competed for control of the gilead 36 37 around 740 720 bc israel and aram damascus were conquered by the neo assyrian empire the kingdoms of ammon edom and moab were subjugated but were allowed to maintain some degree of independence 38 then in 627 bc following after the disintegration of the assyrians empire babylonians took control of the area 38 although the kingdoms supported the babylonians against judah in the 597 bc sack of jerusalem they rebelled against babylon a decade later 38 the kingdoms were reduced to vassals a status they retained under the persian and hellenic empires 38 by the beginning of roman rule around 63 bc the kingdoms of ammon edom and moab had lost their distinct identities and were assimilated into the roman culture 31 some edomites survived longer driven by the nabataeans they had migrated to southern judea which became known as idumaea they were later converted to judaism by the hasmoneans 39 classical period alexander the great s conquest of the persian empire in 332 bc introduced hellenistic culture to the middle east after alexander s death in 323 bc the empire split among his generals and in the end much of transjordan was disputed between the ptolemies based in egypt and the seleucids based in syria the nabataeans nomadic arabs based south of edom managed to establish an independent kingdom in 169 bc by exploiting the struggle between the two greek powers the nabataean kingdom controlled much of the trade routes of the region and it stretched south along the red sea coast into the hejaz desert up to as far north as damascus which it controlled for a short period 85 71 bc the nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes often drawing the envy of their neighbours petra nabataea s capital flourished in the 1st century ad driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture the nabataeans were talented stone carvers building their most elaborate structure al khazneh in the first century ad 44 it is believed to be the mausoleum of the arab nabataean king aretas iv 44 roman legions under pompey conquered much of the levant in 63 bc inaugurating a period of roman rule that lasted four centuries 45 in 106 ad emperor trajan annexed nabataea unopposed and rebuilt the king s highway which became known as the via traiana nova road 45 the romans gave the greek cities of transjordan philadelphia amman gerasa jerash gedara umm quays pella tabaqat fahl and arbila irbid and other hellenistic cities in palestine and southern syria a level of autonomy by forming the decapolis a ten city league 46 jerash is one of the best preserved roman cities in the east it was even visited by emperor hadrian during his journey to palestine 47 the oval forum of jerash c 1st century ad then member of the ten city greco roman league the decapolis seven of which are present in modern day jordan in 324 ad the roman empire split and the eastern roman empire later known as the byzantine empire continued to control or influence the region until 636 48 christianity had become legal within the empire in 313 after co emperors constantine and licinius signed an edict of toleration 48 in 380 the edict of thessalonica made christianity the official state religion transjordan prospered during the byzantine era and christian churches were built throughout the region the aqaba church in ayla was built during this era it is considered to be the world s first purpose built christian church 50 umm ar rasas in southern amman contains at least 16 byzantine churches 51 meanwhile petra s importance declined as sea trade routes emerged and after a 363 earthquake destroyed many structures it declined further eventually being abandoned 44 the sasanian empire in the east became the byzantines rivals and frequent confrontations sometimes led to the sasanids controlling some parts of the region including transjordan 52 islamic era in 629 during the battle of mu tah in what is today karak governorate the byzantines and their arab christian clients the ghassanids staved off an attack by a muslim rashidun force that marched northwards towards the levant from the hejaz 53 the byzantines however were defeated by the muslims in 636 at the decisive battle of the yarmuk just north of transjordan 53 transjordan was an essential territory for the conquest of damascus 54 the rashidun caliphate was followed by that of the umayyads 661 750 54 byzantine madaba map showing the jordan river and the dead sea dating to the 6th century ad it is the oldest surviving depiction of the holy land under the umayyad caliphate several desert castles were constructed in transjordan including qasr al mshatta and qasr al hallabat 54 the abbasid caliphate s campaign to take over the umayyad s began in a village in transjordan known as humayma 55 the powerful 749 earthquake is thought to have contributed to the umayyads defeat by the abbasids who moved the caliphate s capital from damascus to baghdad 55 during abbasid rule 750 969 several arab tribes moved northwards and settled in the levant 54 as had happened during the roman era growth of maritime trade diminished transjordan s central position and the area became increasingly impoverished after the decline of the abbasids transjordan was ruled by the fatimid caliphate 969 1070 then by the crusader kingdom of jerusalem 1115 1187 the crusaders constructed several castles as part of the lordship of oultrejordain including montreal and al karak 58 during the battle of hattin 1187 near lake tiberias just north of transjordan the crusaders lost to saladin the founder of the ayyubid dynasty 1187 1260 the ayyubids built the ajloun castle and rebuilt older castles to be used as military outposts against the crusaders villages in transjordan under the ayyubids became important stops for muslim pilgrims going to mecca who travelled along the route that connected syria to the hejaz 60 several of the ayyubid castles were used and expanded by the mamluks 1260 1516 who divided transjordan between the provinces of karak and damascus during the next century transjordan experienced mongol attacks but the mongols were ultimately repelled by the mamluks at the battle of ain jalut 1260 62 in 1516 the ottoman caliphate s forces conquered mamluk territory agricultural villages in transjordan witnessed a period of relative prosperity in the 16th century but were later abandoned 64 transjordan was of marginal importance to the ottoman authorities 65 as a result ottoman presence was virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits 64 more arab bedouin tribes moved into transjordan from syria and the hejaz during the first three centuries of ottoman rule including the adwan the bani sakhr and the howeitat these tribes laid claims to different parts of the region and with the absence of a meaningful ottoman authority transjordan slid into a state of anarchy that continued until the 19th century this led to a short lived occupation by the wahhabi forces 1803 1812 an ultra orthodox islamic movement that emerged in najd in modern day saudi arabia ibrahim pasha son of the governor of the egypt eyalet rooted out the wahhabis under the request of the ottoman sultan by 1818 ottoman ten arches bridge built south of amman in 1904 as part of the hejaz railway which stretched across the length of transjordan and linked damascus with medina in 1833 pasha turned on the ottomans and established his rule over the levant 70 his policies led to the unsuccessful peasants revolt in palestine in 1834 70 transjordanian cities of as salt and al karak were destroyed by pasha s forces for harboring a peasants revolt leader 70 egyptian rule was forcibly ended in 1841 with ottoman rule restored 70 only after pasha s campaign did the ottoman empire try to solidify its presence in the syria vilayet which transjordan was part of a series of tax and land reforms tanzimat in 1864 brought some prosperity back to agriculture and to abandoned villages the end of virtual autonomy led a backlash in other areas of transjordan muslim circassians and chechens fleeing russian persecution sought refuge in the levant 72 in transjordan and with ottoman support circassians first settled in the long abandoned vicinity of amman in 1867 and later in the surrounding villages 72 the ottoman authorities establishment of its administration conscription and heavy taxation policies led to revolts in the areas it controlled transjordan s tribes in particular revolted during the shoubak 1905 and the karak revolts 1910 which were brutally suppressed 72 the construction of the hejaz railway in 1908 stretching across the length of transjordan and linking damascus with medina helped the population economically as transjordan became a stopover for pilgrims 72 modern era increasing policies of turkification and centralisation adopted by the ottoman empire in the wake of the 1908 young turk revolution disenchanted the arabs of the levant which contributed to the development of an arab nationalist movement these changes led to the outbreak of the 1916 arab revolt during world war i which ended four centuries of stagnation under ottoman rule 72 the revolt was led by sharif hussein of mecca scion of the hashemite family of the hejaz and his sons abdullah faisal and ali locally the revolt garnered the support of the transjordanian tribes including bedouins circassians and christians the allies of world war i including britain and france whose imperial interests converged with the arabist cause offered support the revolt started on 5 june 1916 from medina and pushed northwards until the fighting reached transjordan in the battle of aqaba on 6 july 1917 76 the revolt reached its climax when faisal entered damascus in october 1918 and established an arab led military administration in oeta east later declared as the arab kingdom of syria both of which transjordan was part of during this period the southernmost region of the country including ma an and aqaba was also claimed by the neighbouring kingdom of hejaz the nascent hashemite kingdom over the region of syria was forced to surrender to french troops on 24 july 1920 during the battle of maysalun 77 the french occupied only the northern part of syria leaving transjordan in a period of interregnum arab aspirations failed to gain international recognition due mainly to the secret 1916 sykes picot agreement which divided the region into french and british spheres of influence and the 1917 balfour declaration in which britain announced its support for the establishment of a national home for jews in palestine this was seen by the hashemites and the arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the british including the 1915 mcmahon hussein correspondence in which the british stated their willingness to recognize the independence of a unified arab state stretching from aleppo to aden under the rule of the hashemites 80 as salt residents gather on 20 august 1920 during the british high commissioner s visit to transjordan british high commissioner herbert samuel travelled to transjordan on 21 august 1920 to meet with as salt s residents he there declared to a crowd of 600 transjordanian notables that the british government would aid the establishment of local governments in transjordan which was to be kept separate from that of palestine the second meeting took place in umm qais on 2 september where the british representative major fitzroy somerset received a petition that demanded an independent arab government in transjordan to be led by an arab prince emir land sale in transjordan to jews be stopped as well as the prevention of jewish immigration there that britain establish and fund a national army and that free trade be maintained between transjordan and the rest of the region 81 abdullah the second son of sharif hussein arrived from hejaz by train in ma an in southern transjordan on 21 november 1920 to redeem the greater syrian kingdom his brother had lost transjordan then was in disarray widely considered to be ungovernable with its dysfunctional local governments abdullah gained the trust of transjordan s tribal leaders before scrambling to convince them of the benefits of an organised government abdullah s successes drew the envy of the british even when it was in their interest the british reluctantly accepted abdullah as ruler of transjordan after having given him a six month trial in march 1921 the british decided to add transjordan to their mandate for palestine in which they would implement their sharifian solution policy without applying the provisions of the mandate dealing with jewish settlement on 11 april 1921 the emirate of transjordan was established with abdullah as emir in september 1922 the council of the league of nations recognised transjordan as a state under the terms of the transjordan memorandum 88 89 transjordan remained a british mandate until 1946 but it had been granted a greater level of autonomy than the region west of the jordan river 90 multiple difficulties emerged upon the assumption of power in the region by the hashemite leadership in transjordan small local rebellions at kura in 1921 and 1923 were suppressed by abdullah s forces with the help of the british wahhabis from najd regained strength and repeatedly raided the southern parts of his territory seriously threatening the emir s position the emir was unable to repel those raids without the aid of the local bedouin tribes and the british who maintained a military base with a small royal air force detachment close to amman post independence king abdullah i on 25 may 1946 declaring independence with prime minister ibrahim hashem in the background the treaty of london signed by the british government and the emir of transjordan on 22 march 1946 recognised the independence of the state 92 on 25 may 1946 the day that the treaty was ratified by the transjordan parliament transjordan was raised to the status of a kingdom under the name of the hashemite kingdom of jordan in arabic with abdullah as its first king although it continued to be referred to as the hashemite kingdom of transjordan in english until 1949 93 94 25 may is now celebrated as the nation s independence day a public holiday 95 jordan became a member of the united nations on 14 december 1955 96 on 15 may 1948 as part of the 1948 palestine war jordan intervened along with several other arab states 97 following the war jordan controlled the west bank and on 24 april 1950 jordan formally annexed these territories after the jericho conference 98 99 in response some arab countries demanded jordan s expulsion from the arab league 98 on 12 june 1950 the arab league declared that the annexation was a temporary practical measure and that jordan was holding the territory as a trustee pending a future settlement 100 king abdullah was assassinated at the al aqsa mosque in 1951 by a palestinian militant amid rumors he intended to sign a peace treaty with israel 101 abdullah was succeeded by his son talal who established the country s modern constitution in 1952 102 illness caused talal to abdicate to his eldest son hussein 102 who ascended to the throne in 1953 at age 17 101 jordan witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period 103 the 1950s was a period of political upheaval as nasserism and pan arabism swept the arab world 103 on 1 march 1956 king hussein arabised the command of the army by dismissing a number of senior british officers an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country 104 in 1958 jordan and neighbouring hashemite iraq formed the arab federation as a response to the formation of the rival united arab republic between nasser s egypt and syria 105 the union lasted only six months being dissolved after iraqi king faisal ii hussein s cousin was deposed by a bloody military coup on 14 july 1958 105 king hussein on 21 march 1968 checking an abandoned israeli tank in the aftermath of the battle of karameh jordan signed a military pact with egypt just before israel launched a preemptive strike on egypt to begin the six day war in june 1967 where jordan and syria joined the war 106 the arab states were defeated and jordan lost control of the west bank to israel 106 the war of attrition with israel followed which included the 1968 battle of karameh where the combined forces of the jordanian armed forces and the palestine liberation organisation plo repelled an israeli attack on the karameh camp on the jordanian border with the west bank 106 despite the fact that the palestinians had limited involvement against the israeli forces the events at karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the arab world 107 as a result there was an upsurge of support for palestinian paramilitary elements the fedayeen within jordan from other arab countries 107 the fedayeen activities soon became a threat to jordan s rule of law 107 in september 1970 the jordanian army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of palestinian fighters from various plo groups into lebanon in a conflict that became known as black september 107 in 1973 egypt and syria waged the yom kippur war on israel and fighting occurred along the 1967 jordan river cease fire line 107 jordan sent a brigade to syria to attack israeli units on syrian territory but did not engage israeli forces from jordanian territory 107 at the rabat summit conference in 1974 in the aftermath of the yom kippur war jordan and the rest of the arab league agreed that the plo was the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people 107

threatened to annul the peace treaty 107 army chief habis majali and prime minister wasfi tal during a military parade in 1970 two widely acclaimed national figures on 7 february 1999 abdullah ii ascended the throne upon the death of his father hussein who had ruled for nearly 50 years 108 abdullah embarked on economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008 109 abdullah ii has been credited with increasing foreign investment improving public private partnerships and providing the foundation for aqaba s free trade zone and jordan s flourishing information and communication technology sector 109 he also set up five other special economic zones 109 however during the following years jordan s economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the great recession and spillover from the arab spring 110 al qaeda under abu musab al zarqawi s leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in amman on 9 november 2005 resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured 111 the bombings which targeted civilians caused widespread outrage among jordanians 111 the attack is considered to be a rare event in the country and jordan s internal security was dramatically improved afterwards 111 no major terrorist attacks have occurred since then 112 abdullah and jordan are viewed with contempt by islamic extremists for the country s peace treaty with israel its relationship with the west and its mostly non religious laws 113 the arab spring were large scale protests that erupted in the arab world in 2011 demanding economic and political reforms 114 many of these protests tore down regimes in some arab nations leading to instability that ended with violent civil wars 114 in response to

introduced to the jordanian parliament in the 2016 general election a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary governments 115 jordan was left largely unscathed from the

        "americans of maya descent ethnic group maya americans are americans of maya descent most maya americans originate from western guatemala and the mexican state of chiapas 2 history edit guatemalan civil war and reasons for migration edit the cold war led to the spread of communist ideology in latin america the influence of fidel castro and the cuban revolution led to an uprising by the guatemalan working class maya and peasant ladino workers these groups began forming left wing factions and guerrilla groups like the mr 13 guatemalan party of labor and the egp 3 this armed conflict was a result of a coup d etat supported by the cia against the democratically elected government of jacobo \u00e1rbenz in 1954 the maya population of guatemala found themselves caught in the crossfires of the guatemalan civil war from 1954 1996 during this time period food shortages political oppression and violence led to the death of over 200 000 guatemalan maya to combat communist guerilla groups the guatemalan military issued the policy of tierras arrasadas a scorched earth policy the guatemalan military raided areas suspected of revolutionary actions the military burned the peasant villages and all their crops citation needed this combined with leftist guerilla interaction with indigenous peasants citation needed led to famine and harsh economic conditions for the maya peasant class waves of maya emigrated to avoid military persecution political instability lack of opportunity and natural disasters waves of migration edit the socioeconomic conditions of war triggered waves of mass migration of mayas into america from 1970 4 to the end of the guatemalan civil war 5 many maya families were split up because the males of the household would move to america and remit money back home to guatemala as the war continued changes to immigration laws in the u s restricted mayan s ability to seek asylum the guatemalan civil war was at its peak during the reagan presidency and due to his anti communist doctrine the administration rarely considered guatemalan refugees for asylum since the policy was to refuse economic refugees from communist countries 6 the post civil war migrants are mostly economic migrants 7 providence rhode island also became a prominent destination for many maya people during the guatemalan civil war 8 in the early 1980s and 1990s the guatemalan population in providence began to flourish at first providence was meant to only be a stop in order to reach canada where many guatemalan migrants hoped to receive asylum 8 the maya population in providence continued to grow and many maya migrants began participating in the providence economy by starting small businesses and working for locals 8 however there were quich\u00e9 speaking mayans who also migrated to providence and their inability to speak english created language barriers when attempting to find employment 9 the maya in north america edit maya americans are mostly found along the sunbelt they inhabit many cities like los angeles 10 and houston but they also occupy rural areas due to their agricultural roots many maya migrants moved to poor neighborhoods in big cities which led to even more violence resource shortages and racial oppression most of the maya immigrants are labor migrants therefore they occupy a number of manual labor positions also migrant maya deal with problems in communication and contacting relatives the postal service in guatemala is unreliable so many of maya americans must use special courier services to contact relatives the united states postal service only forwards mail to the guatemala postal service 11 therefore many maya americans do not use it although some maya were placed in crowded urban areas they still own businesses such as restaurants culture classes and other sources of revenue the communal aspect of maya society is very strong as more majority maya populations start to occupy more u s land and form their own means of sustenance for those economies other ethnic maya formed settlements in agricultural societies like indiantown florida 12 indiantown is located in martin county florida and has a growing latin american population most of this population consists of displaced indigenous people with roots in central america 13 certain areas have larger maya populations than others still there are harsh economic conditions and less mobility due to language barriers and forced assimilation 14 the agricultural and communal background of maya confines a large percentage of them to their communities the generational gap of maya migrants also shows the transition from different perspectives as we see third generation migrants began to succeed in the factory setting rather than the rural settings although a large percent of maya americans still do farm a large number of them are in more industrial settings factory life has been a staple in maya society in the united states maya migrants who live in low economic conditions and speak limited amounts of english are often recruited to work in large factories low skill factory jobs do not require english proficiency often attracting many maya individuals to join the factory industry 15 despite the limited english proficiency necessary for these positions language barriers still affect daily work life interpreters are often needed during orientation and due to the various mayan languages spoken many individuals need help finding interpreters who speak mayan languages 15 the average salaries for these factory positions are very low however these jobs allow some maya americans to remit money to guatemala and support their families 15 a large portion of nebraska s maya population works in the meatpacking industry in certain meatpacking factories in nebraska up to 95 percent of the employees are from latinx and hispanic backgrounds 15 most meatpacking factory line workers in nebraska work 8 10 hours daily and in 2012 the average salary was approximately 24 000 15 these factory positions are some of the only employment opportunities for maya americans in many rural areas manuela a guatemalan woman working in a nebraska meatpacking factory noted in guatemala there s work but it s very low paid and things are really expensive there here when you work all week you have money and as much food as you want 15 although some maya americans earn higher wages than they once did in guatemala and other countries from which they migrated these jobs still have very low wages and require long hours and immense amounts of physical labor leading to these factories having significant employee turnover rates 15 once these workers leave their factory positions they typically have to find new employment at nearby factories local advocates in nebraska volunteer to help maya workers navigate employment opportunities and guide maya individuals through the united states citizenship and green card process to help them prosper in the united states 15 culture edit the conditions that influenced the waves of guatemalan migration caused for the forced migration of the maya people some maya would consider themselves as displaced refugees who have a hard time of assimilating into the american culture the process of forced assimilation leads to maya forming more exclusive migrant communities on u s soil the cultural transition is far too complicated to make for some migrants another problem facing maya americans is distinction and categorization mayan dialect is different from regular spanish and this leads to more problems in schools work and recreational life for maya americans 6 the mays speak a large range of dialects and languages some speak spanish and others speak mam 16 yucatec kekchi or other languages processing of their immigration papers is more difficult due to the specificity of their cultural distinction the immigration system largely lumps maya with other latin americans rather than recognizing their ethnic distinctiveness identity issues for maya americans have always been a barrier for ethnic maya in relative terms guatemalans immigrants are a small proportion of latin american immigrants in the us so their identity in america is relatively unknown compared to other racial groups and ethnicities traditional village and family structures are still prevalent among maya in the united states this sometimes proves to be problematic in maya communities and especially in the workplace these hierarchal systems put in place are oftentimes challenged by the separate hierarchies of workplaces 6 maya indigenous roots prove to be strong because most maya americans live in maya and predominantly latinx communities outside of their communities many museums have had exhibits that showcase indigenous maya artwork and artifacts and provide information for the broader community to learn about the maya people for instance the california science center created an exhibition called maya the exhibition which presented a variety of maya artifacts and interactive educational experiences additionally there is a significant cultural sphere of influence in places where maya sought refuge in los angeles the mayan theater was once seen as a revival of maya architecture and art in the 1990s the theater was deemed a historical monument 17 maya culture is still being used for financial gain in many other areas specifically maya culture is utilized in the nightlife entertainment industry where many nightclubs use maya themed decorations and references examples of these nightclubs include the maya lagoon which is a lucrative nightclub located in houston and the mayan located in los angeles various organizations are dedicated to preserving maya culture and provide resources for maya americans the mayan league is run by multiple maya individuals who aim to preserve maya legacies 18 the mayan league also advocates for immigration reform policies and has helped maya individuals access language services at the united states and mexican border many maya migrants from guatemala require interpreters at the border and the mayan league recruits interpreters who speak various mayan languages to help individuals during the immigration process to become united states citizens 18 the mayan league also advocates for indigenous women s rights and protection another popular advocacy group is prima veral inc a united states based non profit organization that aims to aid guatemalan migrants and maya individuals in washington dc and guatemala 19 prima veral has completed various projects including building homes in guatemala delivering wheelchairs to children and helping individuals during the immigration process 19 the role of united states remittances in guatemala edit remittance is broadly defined as sums of money that are often sent from one country to another 20 many maya people living in the united states often remit money to guatemala for various reasons including providing for their families 21 due to the low wages and limited job opportunities in guatemala many individuals choose to migrate to the united states annually 9 out of 10 individuals leave guatemala because of these reasons 22 in 2021 it was reported that remittances from the united states to guatemala surpassed 15 3 billion which was the largest amount of remittances recorded in history and made up approximately 17 8 of the guatemalan economy 22 according to the inter american development bank idb only a small percentage of guatemalan migrants choose to stay in the united states for a long period approximately only one fifth of migrants end up living in the united states for an extended period of time 22 once money is remitted from the united states to guatemala only a small percentage goes towards investment or savings the u n economic commission for latin america collected surveys in southern guatemala and concluded that 57 1 of remittances are used for consumption while only 5 4 of the remittances are saved or invested 22 in order to increase savings many organizations have developed within guatemala to implement financial education and literacy programs 23 the inter american dialogue with the help of partners that include but are not limited to the cities alliance un funded coalition on urban poverty and the united states agency for international development has worked on establishing financial education programs since 2016 these programs have created over 2 4 million worth of savings and run in over 30 guatemalan towns where migration to the united states is popular 22 financial educators target banks where people deposit the remittances they receive and assist guatemalan individuals in making financial decisions 22 money remitted from the united states to guatemala is also used to build homes according to the u n economic commission for latin america 8 2 of the money is spent on building homes in southern guatemala 22 many of these homes are built in quetzaltenango guatemala these homes are considered to be remittance architecture which are homes that are paid with remittances 22 these homes often differ from the local architecture style are usually larger and have more modern infrastructure 24 overall money remitted from the united states by maya and guatemalan migrants plays a large role in the guatemalan economy and drives a significant amount of maya individuals to migrate to the united states 25",

ice hockey team based in new york city from 1925 to 1942 they were the third expansion team in the history of the national hockey league nhl and the second to play in the united states the team never won the stanley cup but reached the semifinals twice while it was the first team in new york city it was eclipsed by the second the new york rangers which arrived in 1926 under the ownership of the amerks landlord madison square garden the team played as the brooklyn americans during the 1941 42 season before suspending operations in 1942 due to world war ii and long standing financial difficulties the demise of the club marked the beginning of the nhl s original six era from 1942 to 1967 though the amerks franchise was not formally canceled until 1946 the team s overall regular season record was 255 402 127 history edit formation edit in 1923 canadian sports promoter thomas duggan received options on three nhl franchises for the united states he sold one to boston grocery magnate charles adams which became the boston bruins in 1924 duggan then arranged with tex rickard to have a team in madison square garden rickard agreed but play was delayed until the new garden was built in 1925 in april 1925 duggan and bill dwyer new york city s most celebrated prohibition bootlegger were awarded the franchise for new york 1 somewhat fortuitously given the shortage of players the hamilton tigers who had finished first the season before had been suspended from the league after they struck for higher pay however the suspensions were quietly lifted in the off season soon afterward dwyer duly bought the collective rights to the tigers players for 75 000 he gave the players healthy raises in some cases double their 1924 25 season s salaries just before the season dwyer announced the team would be known as the new york americans their original jerseys were covered with stars and stripes patterned after the american flag 2 although he acquired the tigers players dwyer did not acquire the franchise as it was expelled from the league as a result the nhl does not consider the americans to be a continuation of the tigers or for that matter of the tigers predecessors the quebec bulldogs the americans entered the league in the 1925 26 season along with the pittsburgh pirates the americans and pirates became the second and third american based teams in the nhl following adams boston bruins who had begun play during the 1924 25 season nhl years edit the americans played their first home game at the garden losing 3 1 to the montreal canadiens in front of 17 000 people 3 however success did not come easily for the americans despite icing essentially the same team that finished first the previous year they finished fifth overall in their first season with a record of 12 22 4 however they were a success at the box office so much so that the following season garden management sought a team of its own a clause in the amerks lease with the garden required them to support any bid for the garden to acquire its own nhl franchise the garden had promised dwyer that it would never exercise that option and that the amerks would be the only team in the arena however when the garden opted to seek a house team after all the amerks had little choice but to agree to the creation of what became the new york rangers the 1926 27 season saw the americans continue to struggle finishing 17 25 2 part of the problem was that they were placed in the canadian division in defiance of all geographic reality resulting in a larger number of train trips to montreal toronto and ottawa meanwhile the rangers won the american division title the next season saw the americans fall even further by finishing last in their division ninth overall with a record of 11 27 6 while the rangers captured the stanley cup in only their second year of existence the americans were thus doomed to a long history as new york city s second team the 1928 29 season saw the amerks sign star goaltender roy worters from the pittsburgh pirates he led the team to a 19 13 12 record in that season good enough for second in the canadian division fourth overall worters had a 1 21 goals against average gaa becoming the first goaltender to win the hart trophy as the most valuable player in the league standing on worters shoulders the americans made the playoffs for the first time but were unable to beat the rangers in a total goals series the rangers had extreme difficulty scoring against worters but the futile americans were equally unable to score against the rangers the rangers ended up winning the series in the second game 1 0 in overtime the following season saw the americans plunge to fifth place in the division ninth overall with a 14 25 5 record worters followed up his stellar 1928 29 season with an atrocious 3 75 goals against average worters rebounded the next season with a 1 68 goals against average that was good enough to give the americans a winning record however they missed out on a playoff berth since the montreal maroons had two more wins which was the nhl s first tiebreaker for playoff seeding the 1931 32 season saw some developments that changed the way ice hockey was played in a game against the bruins the americans iced the puck 61 times at that time there was no rule against icing adams was so angry that he pressed to no avail for the nhl to make a rule against icing so the next time the two teams met the bruins iced the puck 87 times in a scoreless game it was not until a few years later that the nhl made a rule prohibiting icing but those two games were the catalyst for change new york americans logo from 1926 1938 period the americans lackluster on ice performance was not the only problem for the franchise with the end of prohibition dwyer was finding it difficult to make ends meet after the 1933 34 season having missed the playoffs for the fifth straight year the americans attempted a merger with the equally strapped ottawa senators only to be turned down by the nhl board of governors during the 1935 36 season dwyer decided to sell the team as fortunes had it the americans made the playoffs for the first time in six years under player coach red dutton but bowed out in the second round against the toronto maple leafs even with this rebound no buyers came forward prompting dwyer to abandon the team the league announced a takeover of the team for the next season dwyer sued the nhl saying it had no authority to seize his team a settlement was reached whereby dwyer could resume control provided he could pay off his debts by the end of the season however dwyer could not do so and the nhl took full control of the franchise despite the presence of dutton who had retired as a player to become coach and general manager the team fared no better under the league s operation than before finishing last with a record of 15 29 4 the only bright spot was sweeney schriner who led the league in scoring that year the league asked dutton to become operating head of the franchise for the 1937 38 season the americans signed veterans ching johnson and hap day and acquired goaltender earl robertson these new acquisitions greatly helped the team as they finished the season with a 19 18 11 record and made the playoffs in the playoffs they beat the rangers in three games but lost to the chicago black hawks

ii in september 1939 and some of the team s canadian players left for military service an even larger number of players entered the military in 1940 41 with a decimated roster the americans missed the playoffs with a record of 8 29 11 the worst in franchise history while the league s other teams were similarly hard hit dutton was still bogged down by lingering debt from the dwyer era this debt combined with the depletion of talent and wartime travel restrictions forced dutton to sell off his best players for cash the amerks were clearly living on borrowed time it was only a matter of when not if they would fold brooklyn americans edit at wit s end dutton changed the team s name for the 1941 42 season to the brooklyn americans he intended to move the team to brooklyn but there was no arena in that borough suitable enough even for temporary use as result they continued to play their home games in manhattan at madison square garden while practicing in brooklyn they barely survived

after world war ii nhl records list the amerks as having retired from the league in 1942 legacy edit the nhl did not expand beyond its remaining six teams until the 1967 68 season dutton blamed the owners of madison square garden who also owned the rangers for pressuring the nhl to not reinstate the americans dutton was so bitter that he purportedly swore the rangers would never win a stanley cup again in his lifetime this curse became reality the rangers did not win another cup until 1994 seven years after his death the last active new york americans player in the nhl was goaltender chuck rayner who retired from the nhl in 1953 but played in minor and senior leagues for another three seasons last with the nelson maple leafs of the western international hockey league wihl the last

intended for her albums to have such a gap between them i wanted to take a break after one in a million to just relax think about how i wanted to approach the next album then when i was ready to start back up romeo happened and so i had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack then promote it the break turned into a longer break than i anticipated 63 ultimately she filmed

debut album age ain t nothing but a number writer dimitri ehrlich of entertainment weekly compared her style and sound to r b group en vogue 79 ehrlich also expressed that aaliyah s silky vocals are more agile than those of self proclaimed queen of hip hop soul mary j blige 79 in her review for aaliyah s second studio album one in a million vibe magazine music critic dream hampton said that aaliyah s deliciously feline voice has the same pop appeal as janet jackson s 80 according to rolling stone the most remarkable thing about aaliyah s voice besides its flexibility and crisp range was its almost preternatural poise she always seemed to be holding her power in reserve to know every side of the scenarios she described 81 while si\u00e2n pattenden from mixmag stated that she doesn t try to toss the caber with vocal athleticism there s no shouting screeching wailing or jazz style noodling everything is underplayed ms haughton s range is displayed by the slightest high octave backing and tiniest harmonies 82 aaliyah herself said her vocal styling consisted of her singing softly while utilizing her falsetto 83 she further explained saying my signature style is breathy tone y airy it s simple but i can ride a crazy track 84 although she frequently sang in a softer tone there were moments when she utilized other facets of her voice never givin up 1996 and the one i gave my heart to 1997 are a few stand out vocal highlights 85 daryl simmons the producer of the one i gave my heart to recalled aaliyah doing opera vocal warm up exercises in preparation for the songs recording 85 while commenting on her doing opera vocal warm ups simmons mentioned it was the furthest thing i would have ever thought that she could do it just blew my mind 85 the song s writer diane warren praised her vocals on the song saying it showed her vocal range and i know a couple of people thought she wouldn t be able to do that song i thought no she ll be able to do that 85 variety echoed a similar sentiment as warren saying the one i gave my heart to showcased aaliyah s ability to hit higher notes 86 discussing her approach on never givin up producer craig king said lyrically and vocally she just took you to places that you didn t know she could go 85 musical style from the very beginning she opted for an edgier more mature sound and her songs were often uptempo and at the same time often dark revolving around matters of the heart 16 87 she easily straddled the hip hop and pop worlds never projecting the frilliness of her ing\u00e9nue peers 16 after her r kelly produced debut album aaliyah worked with timbaland and missy elliott whose productions were more electronic 88 the duo mixed choppy nervous rhythms over loops of computer generated backing tracks and incorporating harmonies which within the genre s limited horizons seemed daring 25 they also created the freeze and stop style of singing on top of bass heavy instrumentals which became aaliyah s signature style 18 in 2001 aaliyah called her sound street but sweet pairing feminine vocals with a gritty urban rhythm track 89 in another interview she further spoke about her artistry saying i love to fuse other types of music with my own 90 she explored a wide range of genres such as r b 91 92 pop 92 93 hip hop 93 94 funk 91 94 soul 93 and dance pop 95 96 altogether aaliyah s music can be described as alternative r b progressive soul and neo soul according to time s farley 97 aaliyah released musically risky singles into a notoriously fickle pop market without being concerned about conforming to the stereotypes of the marketplace 98 her songs gracefully walk a line between commerciality and experimentation 98 aaliyah s records tend to have a crisp production and staccato arrangements that extend genre boundaries while containing old school soul music 99 kelefah sanneh of the new york times called her a digital diva who wove a spell with ones and zeroes and writes that her songs comprised simple vocal riffs repeated and refracted to echo the manipulated loops that create digital rhythm as timbaland s computer programmed beats fitted perfectly with her cool breathy voice to create a new kind of electronic music 100 in the new rolling stone album guide 2004 keith harris said of her lyrical content that when it came to sexual availability she was between en vogue maliciously taunting you re never gonna get it and tweet blankly cooing oops there goes my shirt 101 lyrically her first two albums carefully toed the line between adolescence and adulthood displaying a woman exploring the terrain of love trust and lust one who exuded a playful innocence while hinting at a more sultry side 102 aaliyah did not usually write her own lyrics 21 the only time she had a hand in writing is on the song death of a playa from the hot like fire single 1997 103 she co wrote that song with her brother rashad haughton and it reflects aaliyah s dark perspective on romance 103 of her role in crafting her music aaliyah said i like to have the final say but i was trained as a singer actress and dancer the interpreter bringing other people s words to life i need the songs to reflect me in one way or another 21 as her albums progressed writers felt that aaliyah matured calling her progress a near flawless declaration of strength and independence 99 104 abc news noted that her music was evolving from the punchy pop influenced hip hop and r b to a more mature introspective sound on her third album 105 nme called her third album radical and said that it was intended to consolidate her position as u s r b s most experimental artist 106 stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic described her album aaliyah as a statement of maturity and a stunning artistic leap forward and called it one of the strongest urban soul records of its time she portrayed unfamiliar sounds styles and emotions but managed to please critics with the contemporary sound it contained 107 ernest hardy of rolling stone felt that aaliyah was displaying stronger technique giving her best vocal performances on the album 99 influences as an artist aaliyah said she was inspired by a number of performers these include michael jackson stevie wonder 109 sade 110 trent reznor of nine inch nails 110 korn 111 donnie hathaway 109 johnny mathis 109 janet jackson whitney houston 112 and barbra

aaliyah wanted her videos to stand out from clips by other r b singers 114 he stated you can watch programming all day and see a certain type of video by female artists then when one of hers comes on its something special something different to look at that s what she was about 114 christopher john farley from time stated that aaliyah s videos for the most part are about mood not about storylines her videos are usually lushly shot and infused with sexual tension though not in overt and obvious ways 114 alisha acquaye from teen vogue felt that there s much to gather while watching an aaliyah music video in fact she thinks that watching them is actually an understatement 115 acquaye further explained there s a state of hypnosis you submit to as she envelops you through sight and sound tugging at your heartstrings between a sequence of sensual strong movements infectious instrumentals and intuitive lyrics that spark emotions of desire sex and empowerment you are enraptured in aaliyah s physical presence 115 most of aaliyah s videos included dance routines while discussing her video choreography billboard mentioned that she coined the smooth choreography and tomboyish style that would inspire r b s future generations for years to come 116 vibe praised several videos saying looking back on her videos like try again and are you that somebody aaliyah s talent in all of those techniques of dancing are apparent as she s able to hit every syncopated word and beat with ease as if she s moving on air 117 kyann sian williams from nme named are you that somebody as a visual that pushed the boundaries when it came to dance breaks in music videos 118 williams declared until that time dance breaks were usually reserved for boybands like nsync and the backstreet boys but aaliyah claimed it for r b stars too 118 public image aaliyah focused on her public image while protecting her private life she felt that it was important to differentiate yourself from the rest of the pack usa today said her slinky vocal style and eye popping videos made her a crossover star while her persistent protection of her privacy added an air of intrigue about her 16 according to aaliyah i put a lot of pressure on myself to be true to myself and not let anything else influence me to do what someone else is doing being a little edgy and sexy is me my image isn t a put on i m happy to put over that dark edge in my videos because it s always been there i used to wear my sunglasses or have my hair over one eye a lot more when i was younger now i m happy with all aspects of myself 90 she often wore baggy clothes and sunglasses stating that she wanted to be herself aaliyah also wore black clothing starting a trend for similar fashion among women in united states and japan 21 in 1998 she hired a personal trainer to keep in shape and exercised five days a week and ate diet foods as her career progressed she went through so many fashion revamps 123 for example when she changed her hairstyle aaliyah took her mother s advice and covered her left eye much like veronica lake the look has become known as her signature and been referred to as fusion of unnerving emotional honesty and a sense of mystique 125 in regards to her fashion choices writer jeff lorez described her as a model of understatement 90 according to lorez she s beautiful but hardly in a high gloss supermodel way more like a really good looking girl next door and rather than bling blinging her ice in a ghetto fabulous manner befitting her trumped up surroundings she blings on the down low a subtle bracelet here a winking pendant there offset by her simple black jeans and matching sweater tr\u00e9s cool 90 former trl host carson daly said that she was cutting edge always one step ahead of the curve and that the trl audience looks to her to figure out what s hot and what s new 57 aaliyah was often praised for her clean cut image and moral values 126 robert christgau of the village voice wrote of aaliyah s artistry and image she was lithe and dulcet in a way that signified neither jailbait nor hottie an ingenue whose selling point was sincerity not innocence and the obverse it implies 127 emil wilbekin told cnn aaliyah is an excellent role model because she started her career in the public eye at age 15 with a gold album age ain t nothing but a number and then her second album one in a million went double platinum she had the leading role in romeo must die which was a box office success she s won numerous awards several mtv music video awards and aside from her professional successes many of her lyrics are very inspirational and uplifting she also carried herself in a very professional manner she was well spoken she was beautiful but she didn t use her beauty to sell her music she used her talent many young hip hop fans greatly admire her 128 she was also seen by others as a sex symbol and did not have a problem with being considered one i know that people think i m sexy and i am looked at as that and it is cool with me she stated it s wonderful to have sex appeal if you embrace it it can be a very beautiful thing i am totally cool with that definitely i see myself as sexy if you are comfortable with it it can be very classy and it can be very appealing 83 aaliyah also felt though her image was risque and sexy it was important to remain respectable because she wanted to make songs that everyone could relate to without it being vulgar 84 when she participated in fashion designer tommy hilfiger s all america tour tommy jean ads she wore boxer shorts baggy jeans and a tube top hilfiger s brother andy called it a whole new look that was classy but sexy the single we need a resolution was argued to have transformed the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman 129 personal life in an 1995 interview with honey aaliyah stated that she was catholic and she attended church whenever she was at home 130 in 2001 she told vibe magazine that she was mostly a homebody and liked the simple things in life 57 family aaliyah s family played a major role in the course of her career 57 beginning in 1995 aaliyah s father michael haughton served as her personal manager and her mother assisted him aaliyah s brother rashad haughton and her cousin jomo hankerson were with her when she worked 131 after her father became ill her brother rashad became her

video shoot in october 2001 rashad said it really boggles everyone that from day one every single video she ever shot there s always been myself or my mother or my father there the circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn t fly that really bothered her because she always traveled my dad had to take care of my mom at that time and i went to australia to visit some friends we really couldn t understand why we weren t there you ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it but you can t really answer the question there s always

sounding late 1971 no 1 hit brand new key often referred to as the roller skate song brand new key sold over three million copies worldwide and was featured in the 1997 movie boogie nights 21 when first released brand new key was banned by some radio stations because some inferred sexual innuendo in the lyrics melanie acknowledged the possibility of reading an unintended sexual innuendo in the song stating i wrote brand new key in about fifteen minutes one night i thought it was cute a kind of old thirties tune i guess a key and a lock have always been freudian symbols and pretty obvious ones at that there was no deep serious expression behind the song but people read things into it they made up incredible stories as to what the lyrics said and what the song meant in some places it was even banned from the radio my idea about songs is that once you write them you have very little say in their life afterward people will take it any way they want to take it 22 in a 2013 interview with music journalist ray shasho melanie elaborated on the origin of brand new key of course i can see it symbolically with the key but i just thought of roller skating i was fasting with a twenty seven day fast on water i broke the fast and went back to my life living in new jersey and we were going to a flea market around six in the morning on the way back and i had just broken the fast from the flea market we passed a mcdonald s and the aroma hit me and i had been a vegetarian before the fast so we pulled into the mcdonald s and i got the whole works the burger the shake and the fries and no sooner after i finished that last bite of my burger that song was in my head the aroma brought back memories of roller skating and learning to ride a bike and the vision of my dad holding the back fender of the tire and me saying to my dad you re holding you re holding you re holding right then i d look back and he wasn t holding and i d fall so that whole thing came back to me and came out in this song so it was not a deliberate or intentional sexual innuendo 23 the follow up single to brand new key was ring the living bell to compete with this release melanie s former record company released the nickel song which she had recorded while still signed to buddah records both songs were simultaneous top 40 hits while brand new key was still on the charts setting a record for

year history edit founding edit the first ac cobra csx2000 at the shelby museum in 1957 racing driver carroll shelby opened a sports car dealership in dallas with dick hall selling maseratis across the american southwest they raced maseratis in the 1957 scca national sports car championship while across the atlantic brian lister s lister motor company enjoyed racing success after installing a jaguar xk engine in his sports cars shelby and hall met lister in england with the idea of swapping a chevrolet small block engine into the lister body they returned to dallas with six cars five of which they sold and the sixth they transplanted the chevrolet engine into which hall raced in the scca national championship this was shelby s first experience putting an american v8 engine into a british sports car body 3 with funding from oil driller and amateur racer gary laughlin in 1959 hall and shelby approached general motors with the idea of creating a new sports car using the chevrolet corvette chassis and engine but with an aluminum body much lighter than the factory built corvette in order to make a competitive sports car for scca racing three cars were delivered and had new bodies designed by carrozzeria scaglietti installed but after the initial three cars gm executives refused to sell them more rolling chassis worried that the scaglietti corvettes would compete with gm s own car for sales 3 shelby continued sports cars racing in the late 1950s competed in formula 1 for aston martin in 1958 and 1959 won the 1959 24 hours of le mans and the 1960 usac road racing championship but was forced into retirement following the 1960 season due to his persistent angina caused by a congenital heart defect in 1961 shelby founded the shelby school of high performance driving at riverside international raceway near los angeles hiring pete brock as a teacher and obtained a distributorship for goodyear tires and champion spark plugs he rented space for these other businesses from dean moon at his shop santa fe springs california 3 shelby contacted several european automakers with the purpose of striking a deal to import their chassis and install an american v8 but he was rebuffed until september 1961 when ac cars of britain replied in the affirmative after the bristol aeroplane company merged with english electric and vickers to form the british aircraft corporation the newly spun off bristol cars ceased production of their six cylinder engine which ac had been using in their ace sports car in need of a new supply of engines they struck a deal with shelby they would ship bodies from their shop in thames ditton surrey to shelby in california for installation of an american v8 engine if a suitable one could be found shelby returned to gm asking for a supply of chevrolet v8s but was refused again for fear a chevrolet powered european sports car would compete with the corvette 3 instead he sought an agreement with ford who were releasing a new small block v8 engine of their own at the end of the year in november 1961 ford delivered a pair of windsor v8 engines to moon s shop and ac s first body arrived in february 1962 shelby and moon installed the v8 engine and a borg warner t 10 transmission into the ac body 3 creating the first of the cars shelby named cobra in order to expand production shelby needed a facility of his own coincidentally lance reventlow s lease at his shop in venice los angeles where his company built scarab racing cars was expiring shelby leased the building at 1042 princeton drive in april and founded his new company shelby american inc phil remington scarab s chief engineer was hired immediately by shelby to continue working on the cobra 3 motorsports cobra daytona and ford gt40 edit shelby american began racing the cobra in the fall of 1962 with driver bill krause entered into the three hour endurance race at the los angeles times grand prix on october 13 krause ultimately did not finish having broken an axle shaft but the car was very competitive with the then new corvette sting ray z06 which was also making its racing debut 4 cobras dominated the scca united states road racing championship in 1963 but the car was less successful in the fia world sportscar championship the cobra s open top body simply wasn t aerodynamic enough to allow the car to reach the higher top speeds its hardtop coupe competitors were capable of particularly the ferrari 250 gto for the 1964 season shelby had pete brock design a new aerodynamic body for the cobra chassis which would make the car capable of speeds over 190 mph 5 the new car became known as the daytona named for its inaugural race at the daytona international speedway only one daytona coupe was completed at shelby american 6 the other five cars prepared for the 1964 world sportscar championship had their bodywork completed at carrozzeria gransport in modena italy 7 driven by dan gurney and bob bondurant the shelby american daytona finished first in the gt classes and fourth overall at the 1964 24 hours of le mans 8 bested only by the prototype ferrari 275 p and 330 p the ford motor company s new prototype the gt40 fared poorly none of the three cars entered into the race finished after the end of the bahamas speed week in december marking the end of the 1964 season ford handed control of the gt40 program to shelby american from carroll shelby s old associate john wyer who ran the aston martin racing program when shelby won le mans in 1959 9 under shelby s management the gt40 driven by lloyd ruby and ken miles won the first race of the 1965 season at daytona and miles and bruce mclaren finished first in the prototype class and second overall at the next race at sebring but otherwise the gt40 program was a disappointment overall once again failing to finish at le mans by contrast the shelby daytona coupe had great success for shelby winning the gt division iii class on the strength of class wins at daytona sebring monza and the n\u00fcrburgring shelby won a title in the international championship for gt manufacturers in the 1965 season with the shelby daytona car thus becoming the first american constructor to win a title on the international scene at the fia world championships shelby american worked with ford to re engineer the gt40 for the 66 season replacing the 289 cubic inch 4 7 l engine with ford s larger more powerful 427 cu in 7 0 l engine 10 the mk ii gt40 achieved great success with shelby american s wins at daytona sebring and le mans earning ford the international manufacturer s championship in 1966 shelby american cars finished first miles ruby again and second gurney jerry grant at daytona first at sebring miles ruby and first mclaren chris amon and second miles denny hulme at le mans recalled in the 2019 film ford v ferrari 11 12 gurney and grant would have finished second at sebring except their car broke down on the last lap and gurney pushed it across the finish line automatically disqualifying them during the 1966 season shelby and ford were already developing a more advanced version of the gt40 known early in its development as the j car on august 17 1966 only a couple months after the race at le mans ken miles died at the wheel of a j car while conducting high speed testing at riverside 13 the j car was re engineered with improved safety features and better aerodynamics becoming the gt40 mk iv in 1967 the mk iv won the only two races they entered at sebring and le mans mclaren and mario andretti won the race at sebring while gurney and a j foyt won le mans with mclaren and mark donohue in fourth after the 1967 season the fia changed the rules governing prototypes and the 7 0 l engine used in the mk ii and mk iv gt40s became redundant ford wound up the ford advanced vehicles group and shelby american withdrew from the world sportscar championship transferring control back to john wyer s j w automotive engineering jwa jwa gt40s won the 1968 and 1969 races at le mans giving the gt40 program an unprecedented four consecutive wins matched only by the porsche 956 in the 1980s ford mustang edit while shelby american was building and racing cobras and daytonas ford introduced the new mustang at the new york world s fair in april 1964 ford vice president lee iacocca promised that the car would be a sports car suitable for street use or competition in his introductory speech to the press 14 in reality the car s sporting credentials were somewhat lacking and iacocca hired shelby american to develop a version of the car suitable for racing the shelby mustang gt350 was created with upgraded intake and exhaust manifolds carburetor rear axle and brakes installed at shelby american s shop in california in place of the standard ford parts with work on the gt40 program and production of the gt350 beginning to ramp up shelby american ran out of space at their shop in venice moving instead to an aircraft hangar at los angeles international airport in 1965 15 the facility is still in existence renovated in 1996 and is now the location of the qantas freight cargo terminal located at 6555 w imperial hwy los angeles ca 90045 the steel tracks used to move the cars during assembly are still partially visible the gt350 was very successful in the scca b production class winning the class three consecutive years 16 the offerings from shelby american were expanded in 1966 to include an optional automatic transmission and shelby famously built special edition gt350s for hertz hertz was a ford subsidiary at the time and when the cars were returned by hertz to ford they were re sold to the public as the gt350h for 1967 shelby installed the ford 428 cu in 7 0 l engine in the mustang creating the gt500 revised front and rear fascias distinguished the 1967 shelby mustangs from the common fords they were based on shelby ran a separate racing team terlingua racing in the 1967 trans american sedan championship with jerry titus winning the championship driving a gt350 the sales of shelby mustangs increased six fold from 1966 to 1967 and for 1968 ford encouraged shelby to move production from california to michigan to simplify the logistics of shipping bare ford mustangs from their plant in new jersey to shelby in november 1967 shelby american s operations were split into three separate companies shelby automotive the mustang production arm was set up in livonia michigan and actual production moved to the facilities of fibreglass supplier a o smith in nearby ionia the shelby racing company moved from the hangar at lax to a new office in torrance california the shelby parts company later renamed to shelby autosports moved to torrance and later to the detroit area 17 after 1968 ford took functional control of the shelby mustang design and production moving production in house for the 1969 model year after the 1969 racing season shelby withdrew from competition carroll shelby announced he was retiring from the automotive business in january 1970 and shelby american and its subsidiaries were essentially defunct dodge edit carroll shelby maintained ownership of his goodyear tire distributorship and set up the shelby wheel company in 1971 in gardena california producing and selling aftermarket aluminum wheels but he remained otherwise out of the automotive industry until 1982 his old friend lee iacocca had become president and ceo of the chrysler corporation and contacted him with a proposition chrysler would set up a new chrysler shelby performance center in santa fe springs california not far from dean moon s shop where the first cobra was assembled so that shelby could assist chrysler s engineers to create high performance versions of their cars similar to his relationship with ford almost 20 years earlier shelby assisted with the creation of the 1983 dodge shelby charger a two door performance variant of the front wheel drive dodge omni for 1984 shelby assisted with the omni glh named by shelby as an initialism for goes like hell the front wheel drive cars were powered by turbocharged four cylinder engines with design improvements more focused on handling than all out power with the success of the shelby charger and omni glh carroll shelby set up a new company similar to the original shelby american shelby automobiles inc was founded in 1983 and began operation in 1985 out of a shop in whittier california near the chrysler shelby performance center producing performance versions of chrysler cars the first product was the 1986 glhs a higher performance version of the omni glh with raised boost pressure and an intercooler the glhs s 2 2 l engine produced 175 hp 29 more than the glh and about 85 more than the standard omni with new suspension components to improve the car s handling its performance equalled or bettered its v8 powered rear wheel drive contemporaries from ford and general motors and even surpassed the 1965 shelby gt350 18 shelby automobiles produced special editions of the charger 1987 glhs dodge lancer shelby lancer dodge shadow shelby csx and dodge dakota pickup truck shelby dakota before ceasing operations in 1990 carroll shelby consulted on the development of the dodge viper but shelby automobiles was defunct just as shelby american was 20 years earlier series 1 edit carroll shelby founded the shelby american management company in 1982 to manage his many other business ventures his business associate and president of the company don landy floated the idea of creating an entirely new shelby branded sports car in the mid 1990s landy approached general motors cadillac division which had recently begun production of a new double overhead camshaft v8 engine called northstar with the idea of cadillac being the exclusive supplier of engines for this proposed new sports car landy was rebuffed so he approached oldsmobile who were building a 4 0 l version of the new v8 engine for their aurora sedan oldsmobile had been in a significant sales decline since the late 1980s and oldsmobile general manager john rock believed the shelby sports car had the potential to reinvigorate oldsmobile in the same way that shelby s involvement with chrysler and the dodge viper reinvigorated the dodge brand 19 14 19 a new shelby american inc was founded in 1995 in las vegas don landy was replaced by another of carroll shelby s business associates don rager and design of the new car began at shelby s shop in gardena california while a new assembly plant was being built near the las vegas motor speedway 19 25 the new car called series 1 was shown as prototypes at the los angeles auto show and north american international auto show in detroit in 1997 19 68 unlike the arrangements shelby american had with ford and shelby automobiles had with chrysler financial support for the series 1 came not directly from general motors instead a select number of oldsmobile dealers were sold the exclusive rights to sell the series 1 cars for a 50 000 per car deposit this financial arrangement became untenable by 1998 and a 75 share of shelby american was sold to venture corporation supplier of the car s exterior body panels and many interior trim pieces 19 116 117 the production of cobra replicas was not part of the transfer of ownership with shelby retaining those rights cars finally began delivery to customers in the summer of 1999 but initial build quality was very poor 19 164 172 deliveries of finished cars did not resume until august 2000 19 201 venture holdings was forced into bankruptcy by the bankruptcy of one of its other subsidiaries in 2003 soon thereafter carroll shelby formed a new holding company called carroll shelby international inc and it was taken public a new shelby automobiles was also created as a manufacturing arm of the new company 1 in 2004 shelby automobiles purchased shelby american and the assets to the series 1 model on december 15 2009 carroll shelby international announced in a press release that shelby automobiles was being renamed to shelby american in celebration of the 45th anniversary of the 427 cobra and gt350 20 cobra reproductions edit carroll shelby international was previously working with texas based unique performance to create new mustang based shelby cars such as the gt350sr and eleanor on november 1 2007

jadeite edit it was not until 1863 that french mineralogist alexis damour determined that what was referred to as jade could in fact be one of two different minerals either nephrite or jadeite 32 nephrite consists of a microcrystalline interlocking fibrous matrix of the calcium magnesium iron rich amphibole mineral series tremolite calcium magnesium ferroactinolite calcium magnesium iron the middle member of this series with an intermediate composition is called actinolite the silky fibrous mineral form is one form of asbestos the higher the iron content the greener the colour tremolite occurs in metamorphosed dolomitic limestones and actinolite in metamorphic greenschists glaucophane schists jadeite is a sodium and aluminium rich pyroxene the more precious kind of jade this is a microcrystalline interlocking growth of crystals not a fibrous matrix as nephrite is it only occurs in metamorphic rocks both nephrite and jadeite were used from prehistoric periods for hardstone carving jadeite has about the same hardness between 6 0 and 7 0 mohs hardness as quartz while nephrite is slightly softer 6 0 to 6 5 and so can be worked with quartz or garnet sand and polished with bamboo or even ground jade 33 however nephrite is tougher and more resistant to breakage among the earliest known jade artifacts excavated from prehistoric sites are simple ornaments with bead button and tubular shapes 34 additionally jade was used for adze heads knives and other weapons which can be delicately shaped as metal working technologies became available the beauty of jade made it valuable for ornaments and decorative objects unusual varieties edit jade rock inspection with a portable uv led flashlight in mandalay jade market myanmar the name nephrite derives from the greek word meaning kidney this is because in ancient times it was believed that wearing this kind of jade around the waist could cure kidney disease 35 nephrite can be found in a creamy white form known in

activist and social reformer from the u s state of massachusetts in 1857 she took in children from the washington county infirmary thus organizing the first children s home in the state of ohio ewing taught school in ohio before becoming a missionary among the choctaw ten years later upon her return to ohio she founded a home for destitute children through her efforts the ohio legislature passed a bill in columbus which entitled every county to establish a children s home ewing also authored a comprehensive historical report on the origin and growth of the children s home movement in washington county early life and education edit catherine amelia fay was born in westborough massachusetts on july 18 1822 her parents william a veteran of the war of 1812 and elizabeth lankton fay 4 lived comfortably she was the seventh of eleven children of whom all grew up and nine reached an advanced age on her father s side ewing was descended from huguenot ancestry through the mother s influence the 12 children became christians in early life ewing s mother was of scotch descent and in the long line of christian ancestors there were many ministers and missionaries in 1835 the family removed to washington county ohio and settled 1 mile 1 6 km east of marietta near marietta college the father came here both to aid the struggling college and to give his sons the benefit of its advantages ewing attended the marietta female seminary 8 remaining in marietta through her girlhood even as her health began to decline career edit educator and missionary edit ewing offered herself to the american board for foreign mission work among the native americans who were at that time included in the field of the board s activities she was 18 when she left home and became a mission teacher among the choctaw who had been removed in 1830 from their homes in the south to indian territory her salary as a teacher was us 100 a year plus her board for 10 years she labored among the choctaw much of the time the only non native american among them living 40 miles 64 km beyond the nearest post office in the fall of 1853 while working as a missionary among the choctaw a physician called upon ewing and asked her to visit a poor family where the mother a new england woman had died leaving five small children they had been committed to his care and he was trying to find homes for them their drunken father having deserted them the physician wanted ewing to adopt a little girl who as two years old she took the youngest for a little while and became deeply attached to the child but she felt the decision was impracticable as she was a poor teacher hundreds of miles from home the child was then taken by a married couple following a drunken fight the child was thrown down the steps of the house and killed this affected ewing so deeply that she became determined to have a home of her own where she could care for orphan and homeless children to achieve this objective she began saving every dollar possible eventually however malaria and nervous exhaustion compelled her return to marietta philanthropist edit her father sympathizing with her purpose assisted ewing to some extent so from these and other sources she gathered a modest amount from sympathetic friends borrowed 150 till her resources amounted to 500 in 1857 she purchased 12 acres 4 9 ha of land at moss run about 15 miles 24 km east of marietta and set about building meanwhile soon after her return from the missionary work she had chanced to visit the county infirmary and was drawn to the young children there living in the same environment with adults these children were often diseased and depraved but she fell in love with them nonetheless and determined to make for them a home many who thought her crazy others suspected a moneymaking scheme some appreciated her motives and sacrifices and helped her on 1 april 1858 in a cottage of two rooms she received from the county poor house nine children all under 10 years of age the county agreed to pay her 1 00 a week the marietta register said the sum was 0 75 a week and half the expense of medical attendance and burial in case of death each child was to have a new suit of clothes when brought to her but for all other needs she was herself to be responsible the first few weeks were very hard ones the trustees of the district school refusing to allow the children to attend school because they were paupers and they were unwilling to have their own children associate with them after a lawsuit she obtained permission to send them to school but the children were taunted as poorhouse children a few months later before the ensuing winter she moved into the new home with 20 rooms and the first children s home was an accomplished fact its cost was 2000 and in five years 4000 had been expended on the property she also built her own schoolhouse and engaged a teacher after the american civil war broke out in 1861 many soldiers children were added to her care her allowance for the increased cost of living was brought up to 1 25 a week and in response to her appeal for such children the state opened at xenia ohio a home for soldiers orphans for 10 years she successfully managed the home and cared for 101 needy children of washington county she faced problems of feeding and clothing so many especially in war times when prices went up and the attention of those who had helped her before was drawn away there was also the issue of sickness when diphtheria and scarlet fever invaded the home activist edit but ewing knew that the need of other counties was as great and some even greater as early as 1862 she began an agitation for a state law in behalf of neglected children she personally went to columbus and pleaded with the legislature in 1864 she conferred with the commissioners about the process at the state legislature to bring about this change the bill was presented that year but failed in 1865 it was again presented and rejected finally in 1866 a bill prepared by hon samuel s knowles of washington county was passed authorizing the county commissioners throughout the state to establish children s homes so the plan which she at first thought of only as a relief to her own children s home became in the course of time the means of creating homes in the different counties of the state washington county was one of the first to act under this law and a farm of 100 acres 40 ha was purchased for this purpose when all was ready for the children s arrival she was asked to take the superintendency of the home in 1870 but she declined the offer as she had married by then personal life edit in 1866 at the age of 44 8 she married archibald s d ewing 1828 1900 who had been an adviser and assistant on her farm after 1867 she lived quietly in marietta still active in good works for many years she taught the primary department of the presbyterian sunday school and was aunt katie to a large part of the children and young people in the upper part of the city she was interested in the temperance cause though the ewings had no natural children mrs ewing had adopted five she died april 4 1897 leaving her property by will to the missionary society of the women of marietta but this society had a temporary existence and had disbanded at the time of the death of her husband so by direction of the

in which she had talked about her marital issues and difficulties these recordings were later used as a source for morton s book 76 77 during her lifetime both diana and morton denied her direct involvement in the writing process and maintained that family and friends were the book s main source however after her death morton acknowledged diana s role in writing the tell all in the book s

diana and expressed his disappointment at the extramarital affairs of both her and charles he asked her to examine their behaviour from the other s point of view diana reportedly found the letters difficult but nevertheless appreciated that he was acting with good intent it was alleged by some people including diana s close friend simone simmons that diana and philip had a tense relationship 82 83 84 however other observers said their letters provided no sign of friction between them 85 philip later issued a statement publicly denying allegations of his insulting diana 86 during 1992 and

love with someone who worked in this environment 93 94 it is thought she was referring to barry mannakee 95 who was transferred to the diplomatic protection squad in 1986 after his managers had determined that his relationship with diana had been inappropriate 94 96 diana said in the tape that mannakee had been chucked out from his role as her bodyguard following suspicion that the two were having an affair 93 penny junor suggested in her 1998 book that diana was in a romantic relationship with mannakee 97 diana s friends dismissed the claim as absurd 97 in the subsequently released tapes diana said she had feelings for that someone saying i was quite happy to give all this up and just to go off and live with him she described him as the greatest friend she s ever had though she denied any sexual relationship with him 98 she also spoke bitterly of her husband saying that he made me feel so inadequate in every possible way that each time i came up for air he pushed me down again 99 although she blamed parker bowles for her marital troubles diana began to believe her husband had been involved in other affairs in october 1993 diana wrote to her butler paul burrell telling him that she believed her husband was now in love with his personal assistant tiggy legge bourke who was also his sons former nanny and was planning to have her killed to make the path clear for him to marry tiggy 101 102 legge bourke had been hired by charles as a young companion for his sons while they were in his care and diana was resentful of legge bourke and her relationship with the young princes 103 charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with jonathan dimbleby on 29 june 1994 in the interview he said he had rekindled his relationship with parker bowles in 1986 only after his marriage to diana had irretrievably broken down 104 105 in the same year diana s affair with hewitt was exposed in detail in the book princess in love by anna pasternak with hewitt acting as the main source 66 diana was evidently disturbed and outraged when the book was released although pasternak claimed hewitt had acted with diana s support to avoid having the affair covered in andrew morton s second book 66 in the same year the news of the world claimed that diana had had an affair with the married art dealer oliver hoare 107 108 according to hoare s obituary there was little doubt she had been in a relationship with him 109 however diana denied any romantic relationship with hoare whom she described as a friend 110 111 she was also linked by the press to the rugby

depression bulimia and had engaged numerous times in the act of self harm the show s transcript records diana confirming many of her mental health problems 118 the combination of illnesses from which diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had borderline personality disorder 120 121 it was later revealed that bashir had used forged bank statements to win diana and her brother s trust to secure the interview falsely indicating people close to her had been paid for spying 122 lord dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue and concluded that bashir had little difficulty in playing on diana s fears and paranoia a sentiment that was shared by diana s son william 123 124 the interview proved to be the tipping point on 20 december buckingham palace announced that the queen had sent letters to charles and diana advising them to divorce 125 126 the queen s move was backed by prime minister john major and by senior privy

well as her ill fated marriage 212 350 biographer sarah bradford commented the only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the prince of wales the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair despite all the marital issues and scandals diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval 21 diana s former private secretary patrick jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person and pointed out charles was not able to reconcile with his wife s extraordinary popularity 351 a viewpoint supported by the biographer tina brown 352 he also said she was a tough boss who was equally quick to appreciate hard work but could also be defiant if she felt she had been the victim of injustice 351 diana s mother also defined her as a loving figure who could occasionally be tempestuous she was often described as a devoted mother to her children 21 353 who are believed

those who communicated with her closely described her as a person who was led by her heart 21 in an article for the guardian monica ali believed that despite being inexperienced and uneducated diana could handle the expectations of the royal family and overcome the difficulties and sufferings of her marital life ali also believed that she had a lasting influence on the public discourse particularly in matters of mental health by discussing her eating disorder publicly 212 according to tina brown in her early years diana possessed a passive power a quality that in her opinion she shared with the queen mother and a trait that would enable her to instinctively use her appeal to achieve her goals 356 diana was known for her encounters with sick and dying patients and the poor and unwanted whom she used to comfort an action that earned her more popularity 357 known for her easygoing attitude she reportedly hated formality in her inner circle asking people not to jump up every time she enters the room 358 diana is often credited with widening the range of charity works carried out by the royal family in a more modern style 212 eugene robinson of the washington post wrote in an article that diana imbued her role as royal princess with vitality activism and above all glamour 21 alicia carroll of the new york times described diana as a breath of fresh air who was the main reason the royal family was known in the united states 359 in anthony holden s opinion diana was visibly reborn after her separation from charles a point in her life that was described by holden as her moment of triumph which put her on an independent path to success 203 diana s sudden death brought an unprecedented spasm of grief and mourning 360 and subsequently a crisis arose in the royal household 361 362 363 andrew marr said that by her death she revived the culture of public sentiment 212 her son william has stated that the outpouring of public grief after her death changed the british psyche for the better while alastair campbell noted that it assisted in diminishing the stiff upper lip approach 364 in 1981 and 1997 diana was one of the runners up for time magazine s person of the year 365 366 and in 2020 the magazine included diana s name on its list of 100 women of the year she was chosen as the woman of the year 1987 for her efforts in destigmatising the conditions surrounding hiv aids patients 367 in 2002 diana ranked third on the bbc s poll of the 100 greatest britons above the queen and other british monarchs 368 despite being regarded as an iconic figure and a popular member of the royal family diana was subject to criticism during her life 346 she was criticised by philosophy professor anthony o hear who in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy and she was self indulgent in her philanthropic efforts 277 following his remarks charity organisations that were supported by diana defended her and peter luff called o hear s comments distasteful and inappropriate 277 further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself 121 which in return demeaned her royal office 346 diana s unique type of charity work which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases occasionally had a negative reaction in the media 346 diana s relationship with the press and the paparazzi has been described as ambivalent on different occasions she would complain about the way she was being treated by the media mentioning that their constant presence in her proximity had made life impossible for her whereas at other times she would seek their attention and hand information to reporters herself 369 370 writing for the guardian peter conrad suggested that it was diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew they were the source of her power 371 this view was supported by christopher hitchens who believed that in pursuit of a personal solution to an unhappy private life she became an assiduous leaker to the press 372 tina brown argued that diana was in no way a vulnerable victim of media manipulation and she found it offensive to present the canny resourceful diana as a woman of no agency 66 former news of the world royal editor clive goodman who later hacked the phones of diana s sons on several occasions stated in a court in 2014 that in 1992 diana sent a confidential directory which contained numbers of senior members of the royal household to their office to get back at prince charles 373 nevertheless diana also used the media s interest in her to shine light on her charitable efforts and patronages 369 sally bedell smith characterised diana as unpredictable egocentric and possessive 121 smith also argued that in her desire to do charity works diana was motivated by personal considerations rather than by an ambitious urge to take on a societal problem 121 eugene robinson however said that diana was serious about the causes she espoused 21 according to sarah bradford diana looked down on the house of windsor whom she reportedly viewed as jumped up foreign princelings and called them the germans 371 tony blair characterised diana as a manipulative person and extraordinarily captivating 347 361 374 in an article written for the independent in 1998 journalist yvonne roberts observed the sudden change in people s opinion of diana after her death from critical to complimentary a viewpoint supported by theodore dalrymple who also noticed the sudden shift 375 roberts also added that diana was neither a saint nor a revolutionary figure but may have encouraged some people to tackle issues such as landmines aids and leprosy 376 while analysing the impact of diana s death and her popularity from a gendered point of view the british historian ludmilla jordanova said no human being can survive the complex forces that impact upon charismatic women jordanova also observed that it is better to remember her by trying to decipher how emotions overshadow analysis and why women are the safeguards of humanitarian feelings 350 the author anne applebaum believed that diana had not had any impact on public opinions posthumously 212 an idea supported by jonathan freedland of the guardian who believed that diana s memory and influence started to fade away in the years after her death 377 while peter conrad another guardian contributor argued that even in a decade after her death she is still not silent 371 and allan massie of the telegraph believed that diana s sentiments continue to shape our society 378 writing for the guardian monica ali described diana as fascinating and flawed her legacy might be mixed but it s not insubstantial her life was brief but she left her mark 212 fashion and style wearing the travolta dress one of her most famous ensembles november 1985 diana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world in 2012 time included diana on its all time 100 fashion icons list 379 iain hollingshead of the telegraph wrote diana had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them 380 381 an early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with charles in 1980 when sales of hunter wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the balmoral estate 380 382 according to designers and people who worked with diana she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes express herself and communicate 383 384 385 diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style impacting recent cultural and style trends 386 387 338 388 diana s fashion combined classically royal expectations with contemporary fashion trends in britain 389 390 while on diplomatic trips her clothes and attire were chosen to match the destination countries costumes and while off duty she used to wear loose jackets and jumpers 387 391 she was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted it was something that really mattered to her according to anna harvey a former british vogue editor and diana s fashion mentor 387 392 her fashion sense originally incorporated decorous and romantic elements with pastel shades and lush gowns 390 393 394 elements of her fashion rapidly became trends 387 she forwent certain traditions such as wearing gloves during engagements and sought to create a wardrobe that helped her to connect with the public 385 391 according to donatella versace who worked closely with diana alongside her brother diana s interest and sense of curiosity about fashion grew significantly after her marital separation 383 her style subsequently grew bolder and more businesslike featuring structured skirt suits sculptural gowns and neutral tones designed to reflect attention toward her charity work 386 395 catherine walker was among diana s favourite designers 390 with whom she worked to create her royal uniform 396 david sassoon designed about 70 outfits for her from 1981 until 1997 many of which were influenced by his jewish heritage 397 398 among her favoured designers were versace armani chanel dior gucci and clarks 387 388 399 her famous outfits include the black sheep sweater 400 401 the revenge dress which she wore after charles s admission of adultery 402 and the travolta dress 387 396 390 copies of diana s british vogue featured pink chiffon blouse by david and elizabeth emanuel which appeared in the magazine on her engagement announcement day sold in the millions 390 she appeared on three british vogue covers during her lifetime and was featured on its october 1997 issue posthumously 403 diana did her own makeup for events and was accompanied by a hairstylist for public appearances 383 in the 1990s she was frequently photographed clutching distinctive handbags manufactured by gucci and dior which became known as the gucci diana and lady dior 404 405 following the opening of an exhibition of diana s clothes and dresses at kensington palace in 2017 catherine bennett of the guardian said such exhibitions are among the suitable ways to commemorate public figures whose fashion styles were noted due to their achievements the exhibition suggests to detractors who like many other princesses looking lovely in different clothes was pretty much her life s work which also brings interest in her clothing 406 versace also pointed out that she doesn t think that anyone before or after her has done for fashion what diana did 383 one of diana s favourite milliners john boyd said diana was our best ambassador for hats and the entire millinery industry owes her a debt boyd s pink tricorn hat diana wore for her honeymoon was later copied by milliners across the world and credited with rebooting an industry in decline for decades 407 408 memorials memorial in harrods department store to diana and fayed tribute to diana on 1998 azerbaijan postage

naypyidaw and its largest city is yangon formerly rangoon 21 early civilisations in the area included the tibeto burman speaking pyu city states in upper myanmar and the mon kingdoms in lower myanmar 22 in the 9th century the bamar people entered the upper irrawaddy valley and following the establishment of the pagan kingdom in the 1050s the burmese language and culture and theravada buddhism slowly became dominant in the country the pagan kingdom fell to mongol invasions and several warring states emerged in the 16th century reunified by the taungoo dynasty the country became the largest empire in the history of southeast asia for a short period 23 the early 19th century konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern myanmar and briefly controlled assam the lushai hills and manipur as well the british east india company seized control of the administration of myanmar after three anglo burmese wars in the 19th century and the country became a british colony after a brief japanese occupation myanmar was reconquered by the allies on 4 january 1948 myanmar declared independence under the terms of the burma independence act 1947 myanmar s post independence history has been checkered by continuing unrest and conflict to this day the coup d \u00e9tat in 1962 resulted in a military dictatorship under the burma socialist programme party on 8 august 1988 the 8888 uprising then resulted in a nominal transition to a multi party system two years later but the country s post uprising military council refused to cede power and has continued to rule the country through to the present the country remains riven by ethnic strife among its myriad ethnic groups and has one of the world s longest running ongoing civil wars the united nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systemic human rights violations in the country 24 in 2011 the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election and a nominally civilian government was installed aung san suu kyi and political prisoners were released and the 2015 myanmar general election was held leading to improved foreign relations and eased economic sanctions 25 although the country s treatment of its ethnic minorities particularly in connection with the rohingya conflict continued to be a source of international tension and consternation 26 following the 2020 myanmar general election in which aung san suu kyi s party won a clear majority in both houses the burmese military tatmadaw again seized power in a coup d \u00e9tat 27 the coup which was widely condemned by the international community led to continuous ongoing widespread protests in myanmar and has been marked by violent political repression by the military as well as a larger outbreak of the civil war 28 the military also arrested aung san suu kyi in order to remove her from public life and charged her with crimes ranging from corruption to violation of covid 19 protocols all of the charges against her are politically motivated according to independent observers 29 myanmar is a member of the east asia summit non aligned movement asean and bimstec but it is not a member of the commonwealth of nations despite once being part of the british empire myanmar is a dialogue partner of the shanghai cooperation organization the country is very rich in natural resources such as jade gems oil natural gas teak and other minerals as well as endowed with renewable energy having the highest solar power potential compared to other countries of the great mekong

coup with more than three million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance 34 according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr there are over 1 3 million people counted as refugees and asylum seekers and 3 5 million people displaced internally as of december 2024 35 etymology the name of the country has been a matter of dispute and disagreement particularly in the early 21st century focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using myanmar versus burma 36 37 both names derive from the earlier burmese mranma or mramma an ethnonym for the majority burman ethnic group of uncertain etymology 38 the terms are also popularly thought to derive from sanskrit brahma desha land of brahma 39 in 1989 the military government officially changed the english translations of many names dating back to burma s colonial period or earlier including that of the country itself burma became myanmar the renaming remains a contested issue 40 many political and ethnic opposition groups and countries continue to use burma because they do not recognise the legitimacy or authority of the military government 41 the country s official full name is republic of the

consonant or finally serves merely to indicate a long vowel \u02c8mj\u00e6nm\u0251\u02d0 \u02c8b\u025c\u02d0m\u0259 so the pronunciation of the last syllable of myanmar as m\u0251\u02d0r by some

\u02c8b\u025c\u02d0rm\u0259 by rhotic speakers of english due to a phonotactic constraint as \u025c\u02d0 occurs only before r in those accents citation needed history prehistory archaeological

century bce the first known city states emerged in central myanmar the city states were founded as part of the southward migration by the tibeto burman speaking pyu people the earliest inhabitants of myanmar of whom records are extant from present day yunnan 68 the pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with india importing buddhism as well as other cultural architectural and political concepts which would have an enduring influence on later burmese culture and political organisation 69 by the 9th century several city states had sprouted across the land the pyu in the central dry zone mon along the southern coastline and arakanese along the western littoral the balance was upset when the pyu came under repeated attacks from nanzhao between the 750s and the 830s in the mid to late 9th century the bamar people founded a small settlement at bagan it was one of several competing city states until the late 10th century when it grew in authority and grandeur 70 pagan kingdom pagodas and kyaungs in present day bagan the capital of the pagan kingdom pagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s 1060s when anawrahta founded the pagan kingdom the first ever unification of the irrawaddy valley and its periphery in the 12th and 13th centuries the pagan empire and the khmer empire were two main powers in mainland southeast asia 71 the burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper irrawaddy valley eclipsing the pyu mon and pali norms clarification needed by the late 12th century 72 theravada buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level although tantric mahayana hinduism and folk religion remained heavily entrenched pagan s rulers and wealthy built over 10 000 buddhist temples in the pagan capital zone alone repeated mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four century old kingdom in 1287 72 pagan s collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century like the burmans four centuries earlier shan migrants who arrived with the mongol invasions stayed behind several competing shan states came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the irrawaddy valley the valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers ava kingdom and hanthawaddy kingdom emerged in the west a politically fragmented arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the kingdom of mrauk u unified the arakan coastline for the first time in 1437 the kingdom was a protectorate of the bengal sultanate at different time periods 73 in the 14th and 15th centuries ava fought wars of unification but could never quite reassemble the lost empire having held off ava the mon speaking hanthawaddy entered its golden age and arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years in contrast constant warfare left ava greatly weakened and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward in 1527 the confederation of shan states conquered ava and ruled upper myanmar until 1555 like the pagan empire ava hanthawaddy and the shan states were all multi ethnic polities despite the wars cultural synchronisation continued this period is considered a golden age for burmese culture burmese literature grew more confident popular and stylistically diverse and the second generation of burmese law codes as well as the earliest pan burma chronicles emerged 74 hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country 75 taungoo and

completely collapsing by 1599 ayutthaya seized tenasserim and lan na and portuguese mercenaries established portuguese rule at thanlyin syriam the dynasty regrouped and defeated the portuguese in 1613 and siam in 1614 it restored a smaller more manageable kingdom encompassing lower myanmar upper myanmar shan states lan na and upper tenasserim the restored toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features continued well into the 19th century the crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire irrawaddy valley and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of shan chiefs its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years from the 1720s onward the kingdom was beset with repeated meithei raids into upper myanmar and a nagging rebellion in lan na in 1740 the mon of lower myanmar founded the restored hanthawaddy kingdom hanthawaddy forces sacked ava in 1752 ending the 266 year

alaungpaya s heirs had subdued much of laos and fought and won the burmese siamese war against ayutthaya and the sino burmese war against qing china 76 with burma preoccupied by the chinese threat ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770 and went on to capture lan na by 1776 burma and siam went to war until 1855 but all resulted in a stalemate exchanging tenasserim to burma and lan na to

history but also one with a long ill defined border with british india 77 in 1826 burma lost arakan manipur assam and tenasserim to the british in the first anglo burmese war in 1852 the british easily seized lower burma in the second anglo burmese war king mindon min tried to modernise the kingdom and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the karenni states the british alarmed by the consolidation of french indochina annexed the remainder of the country in the third anglo burmese war in 1885 konbaung kings extended restored toungoo s administrative reforms and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion for the first time in history the burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire irrawaddy valley the evolution and growth of burmese literature and theatre continued aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era half of all males and 5 of females 78 nonetheless the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of british colonialism british burma 1885 1948 the landing of british forces in mandalay after the last of the anglo burmese wars which resulted

years diplomacy raids treaties and compromises known collectively as the anglo burmese wars continued until britain proclaimed control over most of burma 79 with the fall of mandalay all of burma came under british rule being annexed on 1 january 1886 throughout the colonial era many indians arrived as soldiers civil servants construction workers and traders and along with the anglo burmese community dominated commercial and civil life in burma rangoon became the capital of british burma and an important port between calcutta and singapore burmese resentment was strong and was vented in violent riots that periodically paralysed rangoon until the 1930s 80 some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for burmese culture and traditions buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement u wisara an activist monk died in prison after a 166 day hunger strike 81 on 1 april 1937 burma became a separately administered colony of britain and ba maw became the first prime minister and premier of burma ba maw was an outspoken advocate for burmese self rule and he opposed the participation of britain and by extension burma in world war ii he resigned from the legislative assembly and was arrested for sedition in 1940 before japan formally entered the war aung san formed the burma independence army in japan as a major battleground burma was devastated during world war ii by the japanese invasion within months after they entered the war japanese troops had advanced on rangoon and the british administration had collapsed a burmese executive administration headed by ba maw was established by the japanese in august 1942 wingate s british chindits were formed into long range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind japanese lines 82 a similar american unit merrill s marauders followed the chindits into the burmese jungle in 1943 83 beginning in late 1944 allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of japanese rule in july 1945 the battles were intense with much of burma laid waste by the fighting overall the japanese lost some 150 000 men in burma with 1 700 prisoners taken 84 although many burmese fought initially for the japanese as part of the burma independence army many burmese mostly from the ethnic minorities served in the british burma army 85 the burma national army and the arakan national army fought with the japanese from 1942 to 1944 but switched allegiance to the allied side in 1945 overall 170 000 to 250 000 burmese civilians died during world war ii 86 following

prime minister unlike most other former british colonies and overseas territories burma did not become a member of the commonwealth a bicameral parliament was formed consisting of a chamber of deputies and a chamber of nationalities 89 and multi party elections were held in 1951 1952 1956 and 1960 the geographical area burma encompasses today can be traced to the panglong agreement which combined burma proper which consisted of lower burma and upper burma and the frontier areas which had been administered separately by the british 90 in 1961 u thant the union of burma s permanent representative to the united nations and former secretary to the prime minister was elected secretary general of the united nations a position he held for ten years 91 when the non burman ethnic groups pushed for autonomy or federalism alongside having a weak civilian government at the centre the military leadership staged a coup d \u00e9tat in 1962 though incorporated in the 1947 constitution successive military governments construed the use of the term federalism as being anti national anti unity and pro disintegration 92 military rule 1962 2011 on 2 march 1962 the military led by general ne win took control of burma through a coup d \u00e9tat and the government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then between 1962 and 1974 myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general almost all aspects of society business media production were nationalised or brought under government control under the burmese way to socialism 93 which combined soviet style nationalisation and central planning a new constitution of the socialist republic of the union of burma was adopted in 1974 until 1988 the country was ruled as a one party system with the general and other military officers resigning and ruling through the burma socialist programme party bspp 94 during this period myanmar became one of the world s most impoverished countries 95 there were sporadic protests against military rule during the ne win years and these were almost always violently suppressed on 7 july 1962 the government broke up demonstrations at rangoon university killing 15 students 93 in 1974 the military violently suppressed anti government protests at the funeral of u thant student protests in 1975 1976 and 1977 were quickly suppressed by

an increase in the price of fuel led to the saffron revolution led by buddhist monks that were dealt with harshly by the government 101 the government cracked down on them on 26 september 2007 with reports of barricades at the shwedagon pagoda and monks killed there were also rumours of disagreement within the burmese armed forces but none was confirmed the military crackdown against unarmed protesters was widely condemned as part of the international reactions to the saffron revolution and led to an increase in economic sanctions against the burmese government in may 2008 cyclone nargis caused extensive damage in the densely populated rice farming delta of the irrawaddy division 102 it was the worst natural disaster in burmese history with reports of an estimated 200 000 people dead or missing damages totalled to 10 billion us dollars and as many as 1 million were left homeless 103 in the critical days following this disaster myanmar s isolationist government was accused of hindering united nations recovery efforts 104 humanitarian aid was requested but concerns about foreign military or intelligence presence in the country delayed the entry of united states military

including the han chinese 106 wa and kachin 107 108 during 8 12 august the first days of the conflict as many as 10 000 burmese civilians fled to yunnan in neighbouring china 107 108 109 civil wars civil wars have been a constant feature of myanmar s socio political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948 these wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub national autonomy with the areas surrounding the ethnically bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which myanmar s civil wars continue 110 in october 2012 the ongoing conflicts in myanmar included the kachin conflict 111 between the pro christian kachin independence army and the government 112 a civil war between the rohingya muslims 113 and the government and non government groups in rakhine state 114 and a conflict between the shan 115 lahu and karen 116 117 minority groups and the government in the eastern half of the country in addition al qaeda signalled an intention to become involved in myanmar 118 armed conflict between ethnic chinese rebels and the myanmar armed forces resulted in the kokang offensive in february 2015 the conflict had forced 40 000 to 50 000 civilians to flee their homes and seek shelter on the chinese side of the border 119 during the incident the government of china was accused of giving military assistance to the ethnic chinese rebels 120 clashes between burmese troops and local insurgent groups have continued fuelling tensions between china and myanmar 121 period of liberalisation 2011 2021 the military backed government had promulgated a roadmap to discipline flourishing democracy in 1993 but the process appeared to stall several times until 2008 when the government published a new draft national constitution and organised a flawed national referendum which adopted it the new constitution provided for election of a national assembly with powers to appoint a president while practically ensuring army control at all levels 122 a general election in 2010 the first for twenty years was boycotted by the nld the military backed union solidarity and development party declared victory stating that it had been favoured by 80 per cent of the votes fraud however was alleged 123 124 a nominally civilian government was then formed with retired general thein sein as president 125 a series of liberalising political and economic actions or reforms then took place by the end of 2011 these included the release of pro democracy leader aung san suu kyi from house arrest the establishment of the national human rights commission the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners new labour laws that permitted labour unions and strikes a relaxation of press censorship and the regulation of currency practices 126 in response united states secretary of state hillary clinton visited myanmar in december 2011 the first visit by a us secretary of state in more than fifty years 127 meeting both president thein sein and opposition leader aung san suu kyi 128 aung san suu kyi s nld party

first openly contested elections held in myanmar since the 1990 general election which was annulled 132 the results gave the nld an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the national parliament enough to ensure that its candidate would become president while nld leader aung san suu kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency 132 133 the new parliament convened on 1 february 2016 134 and on 15 march 2016 htin kyaw was elected as the first non military president since the military coup of 1962 135 on 6 april 2016 aung san suu kyi assumed the newly created role of state

seats 139 140 as the election results began emerging the usdp rejected them urging a new election with the military as observers 137 141 more than 90 other smaller parties contested the vote including more than 15 who complained of irregularities however election observers declared there were no major irregularities 140 139 142 however despite the election commission validating the nld s

lowering its level of carbon emissions groups involved in helping myanmar with the transition and move forward include the un environment programme myanmar climate change alliance and the ministry of natural resources and environmental conservation which directed in producing the final draft of the myanmar national climate change policy that was presented to various sectors of the myanmar

reptile and 139 amphibian species and 64 terrestrial ecosystems including tropical and subtropical vegetation seasonally inundated wetlands shoreline and tidal systems and alpine ecosystems myanmar houses some of the largest intact natural ecosystems in southeast asia but the remaining ecosystems are under threat from land use intensification and over exploitation according to the iucn red list of ecosystems categories and criteria more than a third of myanmar s land area has been converted to anthropogenic ecosystems over the last 2 3 centuries and nearly half of its ecosystems are threatened despite large gaps in information for some ecosystems there is a large potential to develop a comprehensive protected area network that protects its terrestrial biodiversity 170 myanmar continues to perform badly in the global environmental performance index epi with an overall ranking of 153 out of 180 countries in 2016 among the worst in the south asian region the environmental

agricultural industry because of an excellent management of the nitrogen cycle 171 172 myanmar is one of the most highly vulnerable countries to climate change this poses a number of social political economic and foreign policy challenges to the country 173 myanmar s slow economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its environment and ecosystems forests including dense tropical growth and valuable teak in lower myanmar cover over 49 of the country including areas of acacia bamboo ironwood and magnolia champaca coconut and betel palm and rubber have been introduced in the highlands of the north oak pine and various rhododendrons cover much of the land 174 heavy logging since the new 1995 forestry law went into effect has seriously reduced forest area and wildlife

observers questioned the fairness of the elections 124 179 180 one criticism of the election was that only government sanctioned political parties were allowed to contest in it and the popular national league for democracy was declared illegal 181 however immediately following the elections the government ended the house arrest of the democracy advocate and leader of the national league for democracy aung san suu kyi 182 and her ability to move freely around the country is considered an important test of the military s movement toward more openness 181 according to the v dem democracy

cessation of trade preferences and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid 186 sanctions imposed by the united states and european countries against the former military government

the myanmar government was constrained by donor restrictions international humanitarian non governmental organisations ngos see opportunities for effective advocacy with government officials especially at the local level at the same time international ngos are mindful of the ethical quandary of how to work with the government without bolstering or appeasing it 243 following thein sein s first ever visit to the uk and a meeting with prime minister david cameron the myanmar president declared that all of his nation s political prisoners will be released by the end of 2013 in addition

yangon stock exchange 251 the informal economy s share in myanmar is one of the biggest in the world and is closely linked to corruption smuggling and illegal trade activities 252 253 in addition decades of civil war and unrest have contributed to myanmar s current levels of poverty and lack of economic progress myanmar lacks adequate infrastructure goods travel primarily across the thai border where most illegal drugs are exported and along the irrawaddy river 254 notably opium production in myanmar is the world s second largest source of opium after afghanistan producing some 25 of the world s opium forming part of the golden triangle while opium poppy cultivation in myanmar had declined year on year since 2015 cultivation area increased by 33 totalling 40 100 hectares alongside an 88 increase in yield potential to 790 tonnes in 2022 according to latest data from the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc myanmar opium survey 2022 255 with that said the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc has also warned that opium production in myanmar may rise again if the economic crunch brought on by covid 19 and the country s 1 february military coup persists with significant public health and security consequences for much of asia 256 at the same time the golden triangle and specifically shan state in myanmar is believed to be the largest methamphetamine producing area in the world the growing signs of an intensification of methamphetamine manufacturing activity within and around the golden triangle and a corresponding decrease in the number of production facilities dismantled in other parts of the region suggests that methamphetamine manufacture in east and southeast asia is now consolidated into the lower mekong region 257 countries in east and southeast asia have collectively witnessed sustained increases in seizures of methamphetamine over the last decade totalling over 171 tons and a record of over 1 billion methamphetamine tablets in 2021 according to the united nations office on drugs and crime more than any other part of the world 258 in april and may 2020 myanmar authorities reported asia s largest ever drug

tons of drug precursors as well as sophisticated production equipment and several staging and storage facilities 259 both china and india have attempted to strengthen ties with the government for economic benefit in the early 2010s many western nations including the united states and canada and the european union historically imposed investment and trade sanctions on myanmar the united states and european union eased most of their sanctions in 2012 260 from may 2012 to february 2013 the united states began to lift its economic sanctions on myanmar in response to the historic reforms that have been taking place in that country 261 foreign investment comes primarily from china singapore the philippines south korea india and thailand 262 the military has stakes in some major industrial corporations of the country from oil production and consumer goods to transportation and tourism 263 264 economic history the trains are relatively slow in myanmar the railway trip from bagan to mandalay takes about 7 5 hours 179 km or 111 mi under the british administration the people of burma were at the bottom of the social hierarchy with europeans at the top indians chinese and christianised minorities in the middle and buddhist burmese at the bottom 265 forcefully integrated into the world economy burma s economy grew by involving itself with extractive industries and cash crop agriculture however much of the wealth was concentrated in the hands of europeans the country became the world s largest exporter of rice mainly to european markets while other colonies like india suffered mass starvation 266 being a follower of free market principles the british opened up the country to large scale immigration with rangoon exceeding new york city as the greatest immigration port in the world in the 1920s historian thant myint u states this was out of a total population of only 13 million it was equivalent to the united kingdom today taking 2 million people a year by then in most of burma s largest cities rangoon akyab bassein and moulmein the indian immigrants formed a majority of the population the burmese under british rule felt helpless and reacted with a racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear 265 crude oil production an indigenous industry of yenangyaung was taken over by the british and put under burmah oil monopoly british burma began exporting crude oil in 1853 267 european firms produced 75 of the world s teak 41 the wealth was however mainly concentrated in the hands of europeans in the 1930s agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices declined and did not recover for several decades 268 during the japanese invasion of burma in world war ii the british followed a scorched earth policy they destroyed major government buildings oil wells and mines that developed for tungsten mawchi tin lead and silver to keep them from the japanese myanmar was bombed extensively by the allies citation needed after independence the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed with the loss of india burma lost relevance and obtained independence from the british after a parliamentary government was formed in 1948 prime minister u nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all of the land in burma the government tried to implement an eight year plan partly financed by injecting money into the economy but this caused inflation to rise 269 the 1962 coup d \u00e9tat was followed by an economic scheme called the burmese way to socialism a plan to nationalise all industries with the exception of agriculture while the economy continued to grow at a slower rate the country eschewed a western oriented development model and by the 1980s was left behind capitalist powerhouses like singapore which were integrated with western economies 270 95 myanmar asked for admittance to a least developed country status in 1987 to receive debt relief 271 agriculture rice is myanmar s largest agricultural product the major agricultural product is rice which covers about 60 of the country s total cultivated land area rice accounts for 97 of total food grain production by weight through collaboration with the international rice research institute 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997 helping increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to 19 million tons in 1996 by 1988 modern varieties were planted on half of the country s ricelands including 98 percent of the irrigated areas 272 in 2008 rice production was estimated at 50 million tons 273 extractive industries myanmar produces precious stones such as rubies sapphires pearls and jade rubies are the biggest earner 90 of the world s rubies come from the country whose red stones are prized for their purity and hue thailand buys the majority of the country s gems myanmar s valley of rubies the mountainous mogok area 200 km 120 mi north of mandalay is noted for its rare pigeon s blood rubies and blue sapphires 274 many u s and european jewellery companies including bulgari tiffany and cartier refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines human rights watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta as the majority of mining activity in the country is government run 275 the government of myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines 276 rare earth elements are also a significant export as myanmar supplies around 10 of the world s rare earths 277 conflict in kachin state has threatened the operations of its mines as of february 2021 278 279 other industries include agricultural goods textiles wood products construction materials gems metals oil and natural gas myanmar engineering society has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to yangon which is a significant underutilised resource for electrical production 280 tourism tourists in myanmar the government receives a significant percentage of the income of private sector tourism services 281 the most popular available tourist destinations in myanmar include big cities such as yangon and mandalay religious sites in mon state pindaya bago and hpa an nature trails in inle lake kengtung putao pyin oo lwin ancient cities such as bagan and mrauk u as well as beaches in nabule 282 ngapali ngwe saung and mergui 283 nevertheless much of the country is off limits to tourists and interactions between foreigners and the people of myanmar particularly in the border regions are subject to police scrutiny they are not to discuss politics with foreigners under penalty of imprisonment and in 2001 the myanmar tourism promotion board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit unnecessary contact between foreigners and ordinary burmese people 284 the most common way for travellers to enter the country is by air 285 according to the website lonely planet getting into myanmar is problematic no bus or train service connects myanmar with another country nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border you must walk across they further state that it is not possible for foreigners to go to from myanmar by sea or river 285 there are a few border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles such as the border between ruili china to mu se the border between htee kee myanmar and phu nam ron thailand the most direct border between dawei and kanchanaburi and the border between myawaddy and mae sot thailand at least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland routes through these borders since 2013 286 flights are available from most countries though direct flights are limited to mainly thai and other asean airlines according to eleven magazine in the past there were only 15 international airlines and increasing numbers of airlines have begun launching direct flights from japan qatar taiwan south korea germany and singapore 287 demographics a block of apartments in downtown yangon facing bogyoke market much of yangon s urban population resides in densely populated flats the provisional results of the 2014 myanmar census showed that the total population was 51 419 420 290 this figure includes an estimated 1 206 353 persons in parts of northern rakhine state kachin state and kayin state who were not counted 291 people who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures there are over 600 000

population was approximately 10 million 293 the national population density is 76 per square kilometre 200 sq mi among the lowest in southeast asia myanmar s fertility rate in 2011 was 2 23 slightly above the replacement level 294 and low compared to southeast asian countries of similar economic standing 294 there has been a significant decline in fertility in the 2000s from a rate of 4 7 children per woman in 1983 down to 2 4 in 2001 despite the absence of any national population policy 294 295 296 the fertility rate is much lower in urban areas the relatively rapid decline in fertility is attributed to several factors including extreme delays in marriage almost unparalleled among developing countries in the region the prevalence of illegal abortions and the high proportion of single unmarried women of reproductive age with 25 9 of women aged 30 34 and 33 1 of men and women aged 25 34 being single 296 297 these patterns stem from economic dynamics including high income inequality which results in residents of reproductive age opting for delay of marriage and family building in favour of attempting to find employment and establish some form of wealth 296 the average age of marriage in myanmar is 27 5 for men 26 4 for women 296 297 largest cities largest cities or towns in myanmar geohive com rank name division pop 1 yangon yangon 5 211 431 2 mandalay mandalay 1

consisting mainly of distinct tibeto burman peoples but with sizeable populations of tai kadai hmong mien and austroasiatic mon khmer peoples 298 ethnic identity in modern day myanmar has been significantly shaped by british colonial rule christian missionaries and decolonisation in the post independence era to this day the burmese language does not have precise terminology that distinguishes the european concepts of race and ethnicity the term lu myo \u101c \u1019 lit type of person can reference race ethnicity and religion 299 for instance many bamar self identify as members of the buddhist lu myo or the myanmar lu myo which has posed a significant challenge for census takers 300 the bamar form an estimated 68 of the population 301 irrelevant citation 10 of the

resettled in the united states 306 the persecution of burmese indians burmese chinese and other ethnic groups after the military coup headed by general ne win in 1962 led to the expulsion or emigration of 300 000 people 307 they migrated to escape racial discrimination and the wholesale nationalisation of private enterprise that took place in 1964 308 the anglo burmese at this time either fled the country or changed their names and blended in with the broader burmese society many rohingya muslims have fled myanmar many refugees headed to neighbouring bangladesh including 200 000 in

many children born to the king and queen of troy priam and hecuba she is the fraternal twin sister of helenus as well as the sister to hector and paris 12 one of the oldest and most common versions of her myth states that cassandra was admired for her beauty and intelligence by the god apollo who sought to win her with the gift to see the future according to aeschylus cassandra promised apollo favors but after receiving the gift went back on her word and refused apollo since the enraged apollo could not revoke a divine power he added a curse that nobody would believe cassandra s prophecies mythology edit cassandra and ajax depicted on a terracotta amphora circa 450 bc cassandra appears in texts written by homer virgil aeschylus and euripides each author depicts her prophetic powers differently in homer s work cassandra is mentioned a total of four times as a virgin daughter of priam as bewailing hector s death as chosen by agamemnon as his slave mistress after the sack of troy and is killed by clytemnestra over agamemnon s corpse after clytemnestra murders him on his return home 13 in virgil s work cassandra appears in book two of his epic poem titled aeneid with her powers of prophecy restored in book 2 of the aeneid unlike homer virgil presents cassandra as having fallen into a mantic state 14 and her prophecies reflect it likewise seneca the younger in his play agamemnon has her prophesy why agamemnon deserves his recorded death quid me vocatis sospitem solam e meis umbrae meorum te sequor tota pater troia sepulte frater auxilium phrygum terrorque danaum non ego antiquum decus video aut calentes ratibus ambustis manus sed lacera membra et saucios vinclo gravi illos lacertos te sequor ag 741 747 why do you call me the lone survivor of my family my shades i follow you father buried with all of troy brother bulwark of trojans terrorizer of greeks i do not see your beauty of old or hands warmed by burnt ships but your lacerated limbs and those famous shoulders savaged by heavy chains i follow you 14 later on in seneca s work this behavior is reflected in acts 4 and 5 as her mantic vision in act 4 will be supplemented by a further in sight into what is going on inside the palace in act 5 when she becomes a quasi messenger and provides a meticulous account of agamemnon s murder in the bath i see and i am there and i enjoy it no false vision deceives my eyes let s watch video et intersum et fruor imago visus dubia non fallit meos spectemus 15 gift of prophecy edit cassandra was given the gift of prophecy but was also cursed by the god apollo so that her true prophecies would not be believed many versions of the myth relate that she incurred the god s wrath by refusing him sexual favours after promising herself to him in exchange for the power of prophecy in aeschylus agamemnon she bemoans her relationship with apollo apollo apollo god of all ways but only death s to me once and again o thou destroyer named thou hast destroyed me thou my love of old and she acknowledges her fault i consented marriage to loxias apollo but broke my word ever since that fault i could persuade no one of anything 16 latin author hyginus in fabulae says 17 cassandra daughter of the king and queen in the temple of apollo exhausted from practising is said to have fallen asleep whom when apollo wished to embrace her she did not afford the opportunity of her body on account of which thing when she prophesied true things she was not believed louise bogan an american poet writes that another way cassandra as well as her twin brother helenus had earned their prophetic powers she and her brother helenus were left overnight in the temple of the thymbraean apollo no reason has been advanced for this night in the temple perhaps it was a ritual routinely performed by everyone when their parents looked in on them the next morning the children were entwined with serpents which flicked their tongues into the children s ears this enabled cassandra and helenus to divine the future it would not be until cassandra is much older that apollo appears in the same temple and tried to seduce cassandra who rejects his advances and curses her by making her prophecies not be believed 18 her cursed gift from apollo became an endless pain and frustration to her she was seen as a liar and a madwoman by her family and by the trojan people because of this her father priam had locked her away in a chamber and guarded her like the madwoman she was believed to be 18 though cassandra made many predictions that went unbelieved the one prophecy that was believed was that of paris being her abandoned brother 19 cassandra and the fall of troy edit before the fall of troy edit before the fall of troy took place cassandra foresaw that if paris went to sparta and brought helen back as his wife the arrival of helen would spark the downfall and destruction of troy during the trojan war despite the prophecy and ignoring cassandra s warning paris still went to sparta and returned with helen while the people of troy rejoiced cassandra angry with helen s arrival furiously snatched away helen s golden veil and tore at her hair 19 ajax and cassandra by johann heinrich wilhelm tischbein 1806 in virgil s epic poem the aeneid cassandra warned the trojans about the greeks hiding inside the trojan horse agamemnon s death her own

athena for revenge against ajax by jerome martin langlois 1810 1838 in the fall of troy told by quintus smyrnaeus cassandra attempted to warn the trojan people that greek warriors were hiding in the trojan horse while they were celebrating their victory over the greeks with feasting disbelieving cassandra the trojans resorted to calling her names and hurling insults at her attempting to prove herself right cassandra took an axe in one hand and a burning torch in the other and ran towards the trojan horse intent on destroying the greeks herself but the trojans stopped her the greeks hiding inside the horse were relieved but alarmed by how clearly she had divined their plan 23 at the fall of troy cassandra sought shelter in the temple of athena there she embraced the wooden statue of athena in supplication for her protection but was abducted and brutally raped by ajax the lesser cassandra clung so tightly to the statue of the goddess that ajax knocked it from its stand as he dragged her away the actions of ajax were a sacrilege because cassandra was a supplicant at the sanctuary under the protection of the goddess athena and ajax further defiled the temple by raping cassandra 24 in apollodorus chapter 6 section 6 ajax s death comes at the hands of both athena and poseidon athena threw a thunderbolt at the ship of ajax and when the ship went to pieces he made his way safe to a rock and declared that he was saved in spite of the intention of athena but poseidon smote the rock with his trident and split it and ajax fell into the sea and perished and his body being washed up was buried by thetis in myconos 25 cassandra puts herself under the protection of pallas aim\u00e9 millet 1819 1891 tuileries garden paris in some versions cassandra intentionally left

leader eurypylus as a part of his share of the victory spoils of troy when he opened the chest and saw the image of the god he went mad 26 the aftermath of troy and cassandra s death edit once troy had fallen cassandra was taken as a pallake concubine by king agamemnon of mycenae while he was away at war agamemnon s wife clytemnestra had taken aegisthus as her lover cassandra and agamemnon were later killed by either clytemnestra or aegisthus various sources state that cassandra and agamemnon had twin boys teledamus and pelops who were murdered by aegisthus 27 the final resting place of cassandra is either in amyclae or mycenae statues of cassandra exist both in amyclae and across the peloponnese peninsula from mycenae to leuctra in mycenae german business man and pioneer

has been onstage silent and ignored her madness that is unleashed now is not the physical torment of other characters in greek tragedy such as in euripides heracles or sophocles ajax according to author seth schein two further familiar descriptions of her madness are that of heracles in the women of trachis or io in prometheus bound 30 p 11 he specifies that her madness is not the type that uses language to descriptive physical agony or other physical symptoms instead she speaks disconnectedly and transcendent in the grip of her psychic possession by apollo 29 ln 1140 witnessing past and future events schein says she evokes the same awe horror and pity as do schizophrenics 30 p 12 cassandra is one of those who often combine deep true insight with utter helplessness and who retreat into madness eduard fraenkel remarked 30 p 11 note 6 31 on the powerful contrasts between declaimed and sung dialogue in this scene the frightened and respectful chorus are unable to comprehend her

government but while he will try to convince the parliament that river and simon are no longer threats he warns that they may continue their pursuit in retribution for getting the word out serenity takes off with river as mal s new pilot cast edit production edit development edit the film is based on firefly a television series canceled by the fox broadcasting company in december 2002 after 11 of its 14 produced episodes had aired 4 attempts to have other networks acquire the series failed 5 and creator joss whedon started to sell it as a film 6 he had been working on a film script since the show s cancellation 7 shortly after the cancellation he contacted barry mendel who was working with universal studios and flat out asked him for a way to continue the series as a film including as a low budget television film mendel introduced whedon to then universal executive mary parent she had seen firefly and immediately signed on to the project even though whedon had yet to create a story 4 whedon remarked universal came in where i thought nobody else would and quite frankly i m not sure anybody else would ve with absolute faith and has maintained it it s been the easiest process in terms of dealing with a studio that i ve ever had and they turned it into not a blockbuster which is not what i was trying to make but not a low budget movie either they wanted to make a real movie out of it they wanted to give us the scope that the show could never have had so all i had to do was come up with a story that was worth that 4 in july 2003 whedon said that though there was interest in the project i won t know really until i finish a draft whether or not it s genuine 8 he felt that any film deal was contingent on keeping the show s original cast 8 though he later stated that retaining the cast was never an issue as universal executives believed the cast suitable after watching every episode of the series 9 in early september 2004 a film deal with universal was publicly confirmed universal acquired the rights to firefly shortly before the confirmation whedon felt that the strong sales of the firefly dvd which sold out in less than 24 hours after the pre order announcement 10 definitely helped light a fire and make them universal go okay we ve really got something here it definitely helped them just be comfortable with the decisions they were making but they really had been supporting us for quite some time already 4 whedon felt it was important people understand that the movie isn t the series and so the project was titled serenity 11 writing edit after universal acquired the film rights from fox whedon began writing the screenplay his task was to explain the premise of a television series that few had seen without boring new viewers or longtime fans he based his story on original story ideas for firefly s un filmed second season 12 whedon s original script was 190 pages and attempted to address all major plot points introduced in the series after presenting the script to barry mendel under the title the kitchen sink whedon and mendel collaborated on cutting down the script to a size film able under his budget constraints 12 all nine principal cast members from the television series were scheduled to return for the movie but glass and tudyk could not commit to sequels leading to the death of their characters in the second draft of the script 13 the tightened script and a budget mendel and whedon prepared were submitted to universal on a friday and on the following monday morning stacey snider then head of universal called mendel to officially greenlight the movie 14 universal planned to begin shooting in october 2003 but delays in finishing the script postponed the start of shooting to june 2004 4 filming edit diamond ranch high school served as the location of the planet miranda principal photography for serenity was originally estimated to require 80 days lasting a typical 12 to 14 hours each with a budget of over 100 million unwilling to approve of such a large budget universal studios wished to shoot abroad to minimize production costs however whedon reluctant to uproot his family insisted that filming take place locally and maintained that it was possible for a local production to cost fewer days and less than half the expected budget 15 on march 2 2004 11 the film was greenlit for production with a budget of under 40 million 16 at the project s completion the film spent 39 million 2 15 considered low for a science fiction action film featuring heavy special effects 16 17 serenity was filmed over a period of 50 ten hour days 15 beginning june 3 2004 and ending september 17 2004 18 19 the film was primarily shot on universal studio sound stages with locations throughout los angeles 16 the sequence where the crew is pursued by reavers after a bank robbery was filmed along the templin highway north of santa clarita the shoot typically would have lasted 30 days but the production completed filming the sequence in five days pyrotechnics were shot at mystery mesa near santa clarita over a period of three days rather than a typical two weeks 15 the scenes on the planet miranda were filmed at diamond ranch high school in pomona 20 the production expected to save money by reusing the serenity ship interior set from the firefly television series but the set was not available instead the ship was rebuilt using dvd images of the television series as a guide construction was completed over 14 weeks on universal studios stage 12 by 23 supervised crews working independently but in coordination with one another universal was concerned about the extra cost but were satisfied when it was completed in just 14 weeks according to executive producer david lester 15 visual effects edit as the budget for the film was considerably smaller than for the tv series practical special effects were used as much as possible if a computer generated imagery cgi composite was required as many tangible sets and props as possible were constructed to minimize the use of computer effects 21 the most technically challenging scene was the mule skiff chase 21 for budgetary reasons a gimbal and cgi much like those used in the pod race in star wars episode i the phantom menace were quickly ruled out 15 instead the crew fashioned a trailer with a cantilevered arm attached to the hovercraft and shot the scene while riding up templin highway north of santa clarita 15 zoic studios the company that produced the graphics for the series had to perform a complete overhaul of their computer model of serenity as the television model would not stand up to the high definition scrutiny of cinema screens 22 23 musical score edit in pre production memos whedon described his vision for the score as spare intimate mournful and indefatigable just as the landscape and speech drew from elements of the western he wished the same of the musical style and instrumentation however he did not want to step too far into western clich\u00e9s to cause justified derision and hoped the score would also draw from chinese and other asian musical elements he wanted the musical elements mixed up hidden or it s as much a clich\u00e9 as the western feel we don t want to be too specific about culture or time we want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to let them take us out of the story but not so comfortable that we begin to be told where the story is music was to draw heavily on what could be carried and he highlighted four instruments voice percussion woodwind strings particularly guitar he cautioned against vocal orchestration believing there to be only two voices in hollywood and wishing to avoid both and advised moderation in woodwind feeling wind instruments to be either too airy or too sophisticated 24 universal studios wanted a composer with experience scoring films ruling out firefly s composer greg edmonson whedon first thought of carter burwell of whom whedon was a huge fan however whedon later felt that burwell was not the right choice because as the film changed the needs of the score changed as well 25 burwell found working on the project difficult as it required he work opposite to his usual approach 26 the production would have continued with burwell but his other obligations left him little time to compose an entirely new score for serenity 25 burwell was dropped from the project a few weeks before the scheduled february 2005 recording 26 david newman was recommended by universal s music executives when whedon requested a composer capable of everything and quickly whedon s instructions to newman for the ship serenity s theme was something homemade and mournful evoking the idea of pioneers who had only what they could carry whedon wished the theme to let viewers know they were now home river tam s theme was played on a uniquely shaped square antique piano that was slightly out of tune the piano reminded newman of river and composed a haunting haunted vaguely eastern and achingly unresolved theme that whedon felt proved newman s understanding of the film s musical needs 27 the score was performed by the hollywood studio symphony under newman s direction 27 the official soundtrack was released september 27 2005 28 release edit serenity had its world premiere at the edinburgh international film festival on august 22 2005 29 30 the premiere sold out 29 and the festival arranged for two more screenings on august 24 which sold out in twenty four hours 31 32 and in the best of the fest line up on august 28 31 the film was theatrically released september 30 2005 2 serenity was originally released on traditional film prints because the original 2k digital intermediate scans were readily available the film was chosen by universal pictures to test conversion to a digital cinema distribution master of the film and to test the workflow required to create a digital cinema package serenity

98 104 105 later adding river tam 106 inara serra 107 and zoe washburne 108 the line was deemed to be disappointing with the figure of malcolm reynolds particularly singled out both won mwctoys silver award for worst line and worst male figure under twelve inches for 2005 109 themes and cultural allusions edit while the film depicts the alliance as an all powerful authoritarian style regime whedon states it is not so simple the alliance isn t some evil empire he explains but rather a largely benevolent bureaucratic force the alliance s main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone regardless of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not 110 what the crew of serenity represent specifically mal and his lifestyle is the idea that people should have the right to make their own decisions even if those decisions are bad 111 the operative embodies the alliance and is as whedon describes the perfect product of what s wrong with the alliance he is someone whose motives are to achieve a good end a world without sin the operative believes so strongly in this idea that he willingly compromises his humanity in furtherance of it as he himself admits he would have no place in this world in contrast mal is at the movie s beginning a man who has lost all faith 112 by the movie s ending mal has finally come to believe so strongly in something individual liberty that he becomes willing to lay down his life to preserve it 111 113 whedon has said that the most important line spoken in the film is when mal forces the operative to watch the miranda footage at the climax of the film promising him i m going to show you a world without sin whedon makes the point that a world without sin is a world without choice and that choice is ultimately what defines humanity 111 according to whedon the planet miranda was named for william shakespeare s miranda in the tempest who in act v scene i says o brave new world that has such people in t 113 a spaceship found on the planet miranda carries the codename c57d a reference to the flying saucer in the 1956 film forbidden planet the plot to forbidden planet is based on the tempest and like serenity features a character struggling with his subconscious 114 the alliance had hoped that miranda would be a new kind of world filled with peaceful happy people and represents the inane optimism of the alliance 115 the fruity oaty bar commercial shown in the maidenhead spaceport bar which carried the subliminal message that triggered river tam is partially inspired by mr sparkle the mascot of a fictional brand of dish washing detergent who was featured in the simpsons episode in marge we trust 116 whedon mentions in a dvd feature that when the fruity oaty bar commercial was being designed he constantly asked the animators to redesign it and make it even more bizarre than the previous design until it arrived at the version presented on screen canceled sequel edit fans had hoped that if serenity had been successful it might lead to either a sequel or a film trilogy 117 118 the first major sequel rumor began on december 1 2005 when ign filmforce reported that universal had expressed an interest in making a serenity television movie for broadcast on the sci fi channel it was expected that commissioning of a television sequel would be contingent on strong dvd sales of serenity 119 in a january 2006 interview whedon doubted the chances of a sequel 120 on october 1 2006 whedon posted a comment to the whedonesque com website debunking a rumor that he was working on a sequel 121 in an interview at the 2007 comic con whedon stated that he believes hope for a sequel rests in the sales of the collector s edition dvd 122 123 in an august 2007 interview with amazon com prior to the collector s edition dvd release whedon stated it s still on my mind i mean but i don t know if mine is the only mind that it s on he later said you know whether or not anybody who s involved would be available at that point everybody s working i m happy to say is a question but whether i would want to do another one is not a question 124 references edit",
        "2019 film directed by steven knight serenity is a 2019 american mystery thriller film written produced and directed by steven knight 4 the film stars matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway diane lane jason clarke djimon hounsou and jeremy strong and follows a fishing boat captain who is approached by his ex wife to murder her abusive new husband first announced in january 2017 principal photography on the film began in mauritius that july serenity was released in the united states on january 25 2019 by aviron pictures 5 following poor test screenings its distributor abruptly dropped its marketing efforts and the film was a critical and commercial failure plot edit baker dill is a fishing boat captain living a quiet and sheltered life he spends his days leading tours off a tranquil tropical enclave called plymouth island and is obsessed with catching an evasive giant yellowfin tuna who he calls justice one day dill s ex wife karen tracks him down and begs him to save her and their young son patrick from her new powerful but violently abusive husband frank she offers dill 10 million to murder him by throwing him overboard she tells him that frank will be arriving later in the week and that they have booked frank for a fishing trip the perfect opportunity for dill to kill frank torn between his conscience and his desire to help karen dill is thrust back into a life he had tried to forget as his world is plunged into a new reality that may not be all that it seems it soon becomes apparent that dill is a character in a computer game patrick created based on his father john mason a u s marine corps captain who was killed in iraq in 2006 patrick had based the character on a memory of his father taking him fishing when he was three years old when the widowed karen remarried patrick introduced his mother and abusive step father as new characters in the game and changed dill s task from catching tuna to murdering his step father dill soon begins to realize that he and the other inhabitants of plymouth island are merely artificial intelligence characters created by his son nevertheless he decides to go along with the objective of killing frank as dill carries out the objective patrick summons up the courage to confront frank in real life and stabs him in the chest with a knife that belonged to his father frank dies and patrick is charged with murder but he is released into his mother s custody while awaiting trial he designs a new computer game in which he and his father are reunited cast edit hathaway stated she was attracted to playing karen because the character puts up a mask defined by the male gaze and also that she was not usually asked to play these kinds of characters 6 production edit on january 28 2017 it was announced that matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway would star in a sexy noir film serenity which would be directed by steven knight from his own script greg shapiro and guy heeley would produce the film through im global which also financed 7 the production received a local government rebate of 30 percent 8 mcconaughey and hathaway hadn t acted together since interstellar 9 on april 18 jason clarke joined the film to play hathaway s character s wealthy abusive husband 10 on may 10 2017 more cast were announced including uma thurman to play mcconaughey s character s love interest although thurman soon removed herself from the production due to scheduling conflicts and djimon hounsou for an unspecified role 11 by july 2017 confirmed cast included mcconaughey hathaway clarke hounsou diane lane replacing thurman and jeremy strong 12 13 principal photography on the film began late july 2017 in mauritius 12 13 the film s production caused a scandal in the country as prime minister pravind jugnauth was accused of having misappropriated funds in excess of 200 million mauritian rupees 6 million usd to support the film 14 release edit in february 2018 aviron pictures acquired distribution rights to the film 15 the film was originally scheduled to be released on september 28 2018 16 but was later pushed back to october 19 2018 and then again to its actual release date january 25 2019 17 it was released on dvd and blu ray on april 30 2019 2 following poor test screenings the movie s distributor aviron reportedly ceased its promotion and advertisement efforts this came even after the film s stars agreed to a full campaign including a junket and as many late night and daytime talk shows as would have them 18 according to deadline hollywood maybe only nine spots aired in obscure locales and not in any time slots that would have helped create awareness for the film and that the film s stars and director were misled about the amount of junket and late night interviews they would be able to participate in to promote the film in response aviron said in a statement as much as we love this film and still hope it finds its audience we tested and retested the film with audiences and critics alike and sadly the data demonstrated that the film was not going to be able to perform at our initial expectations so we adjusted our budget and marketing tactics accordingly 19 some of the film s stars such as mcconaughey and hathaway were reportedly upset because aviron pledged to put up a promotion and advertising campaign commensurate with a 2500 screen release 19 scott mendelson a writer for forbes defended aviron s decision stating an original r rated star driven sexually explicit thriller from a small distributor with poor reviews a d from cinemascore and understandably misleading marketing is the very definition of doa concluding aviron would merely have been burning money to spend any more on marketing serenity than they already did 20 reception edit box office edit serenity grossed 8 5 million in the united states and canada 3 and 5 8 million in other territories for a total worldwide gross of 14 4 million plus 1 4 million with home video sales against a production budget of 25 million 2 in the united states and canada serenity was released alongside the kid who would be king and was initially projected to gross around 7 million from 2 561 theaters in its opening weekend 21 the film made 1 6 million on its first day including 250 000 from thursday night previews lowering estimates to 4 million it ended up debuting to 4 4 million finishing eighth and marking the worst wide release opening of hathaway s career 22 in its second weekend the film fell 62 to 1 7 million finishing 14th 23 critical response edit on review aggregator rotten tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 21 based on 199 reviews and an average rating of 4 1 10 the website s critical consensus reads a high concept mystery with a twist serenity isn t what it appears to be at first unfortunately it s also not anywhere near as clever or entertaining as it thinks 24 on metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100 based on 38 critics indicating generally unfavorable reviews 25 audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of d on an a to f scale while those at posttrak gave it an overall positive score of 56 and a recommend rating of 34 22 christy lemire of rogerebert com gave the film one star calling it terrible and insane and writing similar to collateral beauty and the book of henry recent dramas with esteemed casts that went off the rails in enjoyably awful ways serenity is the kind of bonkers movie that truly must be seen to be believed 26 the hollywood reporter s todd mccarthy wrote actors can usually have fun with such melodramatic roles but knight s stratagems serve to straitjacket the cast more than liberate it to diminishing returns as the climax remains an elusive vision on the horizon like a long fishing day without a bite serenity invites impatience rather than excited anticipation and the eventual payoff provokes a big huh 5 several reviewers including vanity fair and the independent criticized the plot twist 27 28 in his review for the new york observer rex reed stated that the new year is not even a month old but a hunk of junk called serenity already qualifies as the worst film of 2019 and that a t the critics screening i attended the audience was reduced to hysterics 29 michael o sullivan of the washington post wrote that t he dialogue is bad to the point of self parody the performances are cartoonish especially that of hathaway whose femme fatale comes across as a kind of live action jessica rabbit from who framed roger rabbit and the scenario abounds with clich\u00e9 and lazy shorthand 5 this view was shared by the new yorker review which cited the film as a mere collection of cliches that were assembled as a meta movie 30 in rolling stone peter travers defined serenity like the bastard child of body heat and the sixth sense minus the heat and the sense 31 the movie ended up on several lists of worst movies of 2019 including hollywood reporter the a v club variety and cbs news 32 33 34 35 accolades edit the film was nominated for two golden raspberry awards matthew mcconaughey for worst actor and anne hathaway for worst actress

plans to ship plutonium from uchikon 7 are leaked to refugee terrorists despite a coast guard raid that managed to halt a weapons sale to the terrorists there are lingering worries that they may still attempt to capture the plutonium to counter this section 9 is covertly assigned the mission of escorting the material out of the refugee district commanding the operation is kazundo goda who accompanies section 9 to oversee the transfer he and the team are inserted into the refugee district by paradrop and arrive at gsda checkpoint where they are redressed in clothes befitting refugees and tasked with guarding a beat up suv and shuttle bus commandeered by other members of section 9 for the purpose of moving the plutonium meanwhile goda discusses the mission with the commanding officer of the gsda unit who assigns three men to help section 9 with their transport of the plutonium the team departs from the camp and proceeds to head out of the refugee district via the beltway

garbage truck prompting section 9 members to exit their vehicles and investigate further during a conversation with the refugees near the truck a gsda member mistakes a bent pipe in the hands of one refugee for a pistol and an ensuing shootout results in the needless death of several refugees and ill feelings among the group these feelings are further increased when after arriving at the intended

hacks into the cabinet intelligence agency server decatonchire to uncover goda s motives during her subsequent meeting with goda she learns that he once had ambitions to be counted among the powerful but has since resigned himself to never having that position he aims to create a new hero for the masses someone whom they can identify with beyond simply knowing that person s face or name goda expects this person to take command of the situation he is currently creating and bring about some type of conflict which he believes will benefit japan in the long run by returning the country to its former glory elsewhere batou borma and togusa are out to stop a suicide bomber but so far have only been playing catchup until batou trusts a hunch and has the chief check out the local surveillance systems for people thought to be the bombers his hunch pays off as the images of the bombers reveal all of them to be refugees prompting aramaki to issue warnings to all police districts in the city to watch for refugees acting suspiciously one such refugee turns up at a subway station claiming she has a bomb batou and togusa arrive to find the woman surrounded by sat officers togusa has nearly

and screams for help trying to protect the woman togusa fires several rounds into her assailant s prosthetic limbs in an effort to disable him despite this togusa fails to prevent the woman s death since togusa carried out the shooting while off duty a preliminary hearing is convened to ascertain the facts in the case the suspect s parents hire a well known lawyer to defend their son who wastes no time attempting to make togusa look bad first by criticizing his choice of handgun and then by claiming that togusa acted out of a subconscious hatred for cyborgs while making the excuse that the defendant suffered from defective prosthetic parts when section 9 sets out to clear togusa s name they stumble across some interesting information about the suspect s lawyer apparently he has been secretly colluding with prosthetics companies to rig and bury product defect lawsuits in addition he is likely acting under orders from the cis to use the case to pull all of section 9 into court to embroil them in a humiliating public scandal kusanagi threatens to expose these secrets in court which prompts the lawyer to drop his charges against togusa while the state formally brings murder charges against the suspect however the lawyer and his client are later severely injured in a car accident implied to have been set up by section 9 in retaliation for togusa s public humiliation 37 11

target to track and eventually she loses all four teams shortly after shaking off the last team kusanagi unexpectedly loses all communication and finds herself lost in a seemingly empty part of the city while trying to locate her team she happens across a shop that stores people s external memories and hears the story of two child prosthetic bodies carefully preserved in the shop the bodies once belong to a boy and a girl who were involved in a terrible plane crash leaving the two children the only survivors of the wreck after the other mortally wounded passengers die while the boy was in the hospital he learned that he had been paralyzed except for his left hand which he used to make origami cranes non stop for the girl one day the girl who had been in a coma since arriving in the hospital unexpectedly went downhill fast and was moved to the or the boy believed that she had died but two years later a girl his age was brought to the hospital in an effort to convince the boy to switch to a full cyborg prosthetic body after previous attempts by a relative and doctors to convince him had failed the boy was reluctant to do so at first because the girl had difficulty with the fine motor skills of her own new body but he eventually relented and accepted the prosthetic body after realizing the girl visiting him was the very same one from the crash who he believed had died years later the boy who had been searching for the girl since he left the hospital happened across her childhood prosthetic in a lab and took it upon himself to preserve it when kusanagi inquires as to the current whereabouts of the boy she learns that he was shipped out in the last days of the war and has not been heard from since before kusanagi leaves she carefully folds a sugar cube wrapper into an origami crane and places it in the car beside the body of the boy saying i ll bet that even now that girl is still searching for the first boy she ever loved 38 12 in to those without even a

the tachikomas assigned to the security truck shift their discussion from the reason for the new security treaty to the reason that saito is consistently winning at a game of chance for a raise in the game saito offers to share the story of how he acquired his poker face and why it s helping him win in 2020 the american empire invaded central america in an effort to stop the drug trade tired of japan s lack of involvement in the war saito decided to hire himself out as a mercenary and was picked up by a group fighting to keep mexico s provisional government in place one day saito caught wind of a special forces team which happens to be a force of un peacekeepers with a tactical nuclear weapon that would be passing through the destroyed remains of monterrey where saito was stationed saito decided to engage the group and managed to kill a total of three people before the spec ops team determined his location headed by kusanagi the remaining members of the team stormed the hospital saito was camped out in but not before he managed to kill two more men outnumbered and cornered saito believed that kusanagi would likely kill him in a one on one shootout but believed that she lacked the necessary software to snipe him at medium range saito tried to engage kusanagi before she could download the midrange sniping software only for her to disable him by shooting out his left eye kusanagi explained that she already had the software and had intentionally acted as though she didn t to lure saito out and neutralize him impressed with his ability kusanagi took saito with her which was how he ended up working for section 9 as the episode comes to a close the possibility arises that the story which saito just told was completely fabricated perhaps using the plot of an old movie the

batou togusa and the tachikoma dash to the scene having learned that a man named asuda may have been in the building the team regroups aboard the tiltrotor for a trip to niihama airport along the way batou and togusa learn from kusanagi that asuda is the inventor of the tachikoma ai and may be attempting to defect to north america to obtain patent rights which he cannot get in japan as a state

attempt to distance themselves from the problem while top ranking military officials and local law enforcement voice their concern over the sudden influx of refugees to dejima island when a recess is called the prime minister meets with aramaki and kusanagi who alert her to the existence of cyberbrain hubs during her briefing with aramaki the prime minister reveals that her lack of clout is being taken advantage of by some members of her cabinet and exploited for their own ends it seems that some members of the cabinet are attempting to force kayabuki out of the picture and section 9 is asked to look into the matter meanwhile ishikawa returns from the korean peninsula and briefs the rest of section 9 on what he found out about kuze s past during the war kuze was in the ground self defense army and was deployed to korea shortly after the country unified to safeguard the north territories from the retreating people s army kuze was assigned to a mechanized battalion and his unit saw action in defense of a refugee village along a river near the korea china border since article 9 of the japanese constitution prevents japan s military from deploying overseas in any official capacity a press blackout had been in effect but this worked against kuze s unit when rumors began to circulate that they were somehow involved in the slaughter of the refugees one day kuze exchanged his gun for a camera and went into the refugee camp near his base and after a time became an accepted and well liked member of the refugee community there when the gsda forces received orders to head home kuze disappeared presumably heading over the border into china ishikawa reports that the last known location for kuze was in taiwan and the briefing concludes 43 17 di mother and child red data

while on the street kusanagi meets a street kid named chai with aspirations of make it big in the drug trade chai is already in trouble for stealing cocaine from a rival gang called the xiaojie and reveals to kusanagi that he and his friends intend to pressure mold the drugs into animal figurines for shipment overseas at the end of the day kusanagi heads for her hotel and chai spends the night with her but at dawn kusanagi discovers he has left on her way to the airport kusanagi discovers a bathhouse key in her pocketbook and follows it to its source to recover the remaining cocaine from a locker there deducing that chai has gone to the huanlong yakuza headquarters kusanagi storms the building catching both the xiaojie and the three yakuza heads off guard with two separate weapons pointed at the yakuza heads and the xiaojie kusanagi discloses her terms in exchange for chai s safety and a promise from the yakuza not to retaliate against the refugees in taiwan she will hand over

give kuze his very best script with dejima now cordoned off by officers in riot gear section 9 decides to launch a surgical strike against the militant refugees aimed at capturing kuze the belief is that if kuze is captured the independence movement in dejima will die down upon arriving in dejima section 9 splits into two units with kusanagi and ishikawa diving the net trying to trace kuze s cyberbrain while the others head into dejima with a spec ops truck and two tachikoma units the ground team learns that kuze has been in dejima and garnered a great following among the refugees while kusanagi succeeds in locating kuze s cyberbrain her plan is to hack kuze s eyes to determine his whereabouts but she encounters a vicious backlash after coming into contact with kuze the experience rattles kusanagi but she succeeds in locating kuze in a camouflaged harbor in northeastern dejima section 9 reconvenes and prepares to raid the three fishing trawlers anchored there while checking out one of the trawlers kusanagi discovers a cyberbrain filter and deduces immediately that kuze is not in the harbor but before she can relay this information a gunfight erupts between armed refugees and section 9 leading to the death of a new section 9 recruit named yano batou hounds kusanagi for the previous mistake before learning from her that kuze has gone to russia with the intention of

where kuze s plutonium deal would go down aramaki pulls some strings and learns that the probable location for such an act would be etorofu island section 9 is dispatched to the island with the objective of stopping the deal while a request is formally made for a japanese maritime self defense force security net to catch kuze if he happens to evade capture on the way to the island kusanagi explains that kuze is very rapidly rising to power and may eventually become a dictator of sorts if he is not stopped soon she further explains that the refugees can see and feel what he experiences in real time which helps him win them over upon arriving in etorofu section 9 splits into three units batou saito and two tachikomas head to an abandoned russian submarine base believed to be the site of the deal togusa and kusanagi go to see a man named krolden who has helped the latter in the past and the rest of the team remains with the tiltrotor kusanagi discovers that krolden has been killed by an attack barrier after diving and hacking into something he should not have seen and when she calls up the records of his dive she discovers a plan by the russian mafia to sell plutonium to the refugees for 240 million yen kusanagi also uncovers evidence that the cabinet intelligence agency may be pulling the strings behind the deal armed with this information section 9 sets out to stop the deal meanwhile one of the refugees aboard the boat confronts kuze over the death of densetsu a rapper who served as an inspirational figure to the refugees at the hands of the individual eleven the man intends to detonate a suicide bomb he has strapped to his body which will kill kuze and sink the ship unless kuze can explain the purpose for the refugees trip to russia kuze explains his plan to use the plutonium to build a nuclear weapon that will deter japan and other foreign powers from invading dejima this ultimately wins over the young man but when kuze leaves to conduct the plutonium deal his group of refugees become involved in a three way firefight with two sda issued armoured suits and section 9 s tachikomas batou catches up to kuze and the episode ends with him holding kuze at

arrives at the scene she and the tachikoma assigned to her destroy the other gsda combat suit and manage to locate batou who informs them that kuze has gotten away kusanagi and her tachikoma race after kuze and in the process meet up with saito and his tachikoma together they head to the harbor in an attempt to stop the fishing trawler from leaving but the refugees provide cover fire for kuze and manage to keep section 9 at bay long enough for the trawler to escape from the harbor and make it out to sea section 9 regroups at the top of the hidden sub base to wait for the tiltrotor to arrive but when the aircraft sets down to retrieve the team the suicide bomber who came with kuze gains access to the tiltrotor and detonates his bomb destroying the aircraft killing two section 9 operators and seriously injuring ishikawa the loss of the tiltrotor removes any chance of section 9 pursuing kuze so the team shifts its focus to getting medical attention for their wounded comrades kusanagi and the remaining section 9 members attempt to retrieve data on the plutonium purchase by accessing sagawa s records only to discover that their records have been deleted taking all of this into account aramaki and kusanagi outline a hypothesis that has the cabinet intelligence agency pulling the strings behind the plutonium deal and further speculate that kuze may not have acquired the plutonium he wanted from the russians after all in the midst of this briefing section 9 receives word that the coast guard net has spotted kuze s boat attempting to enter dejima the coast guard cutter and the fishing trawler exchange shots leading to a fire on kuze s boat but just when it seems that kuze will be captured nagasaki unexpectedly suffers a massive blackout allowing kuze to escape from the trawler with the plutonium however when he inspects the case he discovers that he had been given lead bars instead of plutonium but hides this revelation from the refugees 48 22 du abandoned city

discovered a tactical nuclear device in fukuoka s ky\u016bsh\u016b telecom tower and some 35 million citizens are subsequently evacuated over a five day period to allow the ground self defense force to safely defuse and remove the device it is assumed that the culprits behind the bomb are militant refugees but section 9 thinks otherwise and with the prime minister s permission they enter the hot zone to investigate the bomb firsthand borma and paz are sent to inspect the bomb itself which appears to be a dirty bomb but upon closer inspection borma deduces the device had elements of an implosion bomb which uses american explosives the unexpected discovery of american material in the bomb creates confusion among the techs disarming it as the refugees have always used c 4 explosives in their bombs while paz and borma handle the bomb defusal batou takes goda up to the roof of the radio tower for a discussion using kusanagi s external memory batou plays with goda s mind by calling him second rate ordinary and a copycat in an effort to bruise his ego and obtain information on the individual eleven and the refugee situation the plan works as goda provides his insight into the case revealing information that could only be known to the mastermind of the entire incident in the process meanwhile kusanagi and saito commandeer a gsda disposal truck and masquerading as the bomb removal team secure the plutonium from the bomb kusanagi plans to transport the plutonium to spring 8 for analysis expecting that the techs at the facility can link the plutonium from the nuclear bomb to the plutonium from the cis run nuclear power plant in the uchikon 7 district of new tokyo s shinjuku refugee district since section 9 believes that kuze did not obtain plutonium in russia the revelation that the cabinet intelligence service is behind the bomb will defuse the growing sentiment that the refugees must be expelled from japan elsewhere aramaki meets with prime minister kayabuki to urge her not to send in the gsda but she feels she has no other choice in the matter everything discovered so far points to the refugees at aramaki s urging she decides to present his report to the

to deploy the army to retrieve the remaining plutonium supposedly hidden on dejima island reluctantly kayabuki agrees to the plan and returns to her office to report the decision to aramaki after mulling over the available options aramaki suggests that kayabuki put in a request to the united nations and ask for the dispatch of their nuclear inspectors to dejima to collect the plutonium she agrees and instructs the chief cabinet secretary to make the announcement in the press room the unexpected un involvement catches the man off guard to protect his own interests he asks an aide to begin the process to remove kayabuki from power the cleverly timed announcement made by kayabuki ruins the chief cabinet secretary s plan for a military invasion of dejima as it will take un inspectors 48 hours to arrive in japan despite this the japanese ground self defense army and japanese maritime self defense force are ordered to surround dejima elsewhere section 9 has transferred the plutonium from the bomb in fukuoka to one of their own undercover trucks and have started moving the material to spring 8 but while en route to the facility the team discovers that they have been cut off from the chief in the absence of his instructions kusanagi assumes command of all section 9 members and abruptly changes their plan rather than move the plutonium to spring 8 section 9 will take it into dejima and capture kuze so that they can hand them both over to the un the team agrees and the plan is put into motion but before infiltrating dejima a single tachikoma containing a sample of the plutonium is dispatched to ishikawa who has volunteered to take the sample to spring 8 using the sda mobilization as a cover section 9 captures a military transport chopper and head for dejima to put their plan into action meanwhile the refugees are becoming anxious the military has blockaded dejima and the two sides face each other down from opposite sides of the bridge that leads into dejima thanks to a last second internet message from kusanagi kuze realizes that the japanese army is coming but before he can do anything about it the refugees connection to kuze s cyberbrain

blueprints and up to date information on section 9 s dejima operation as well as the location of kayabuki with this information in hand togusa and the chief set out to rescue kayabuki and put the brakes on the dejima situation before things get even worse elsewhere kusanagi and the rest of section 9 batou borma saito and paz manage to infiltrate dejima island in their captured military chopper but before the team can safely disembark a number of jigabachi aircraft fire on the helicopter disabling the rotor kusanagi bails from the chopper before it crashes intending to locate kuze while the rest of the team is tasked with presenting the missing plutonium to the un inspection team unfortunately section 4 has been dispatched to retrieve the missing plutonium as well and they mistake section 9 operatives for militant refugees resulting in a shootout across the streets of dejima as both sides attempt to secure and present the plutonium meanwhile kuze leads a small band of refugees armed with stinger missiles to the docks of dejima island the quartet manages to shoot down the e2c hawkeye responsible for the communications jamming signal over dejima and allow the refugees to gain access to his cyberbrain once more from the refugees kuze learns of the developing situation the army and navy are attacking the island with airstrikes missiles and naval artillery they have also deployed radiation scrubbers in the air in and around dejima to prevent any fallout from the nuclear material the refugees have from escaping the area unchecked for the moment dejima island is safe from invasion because the only land bridge into the facility has been destroyed but the army has begun to move portable bridge equipment in to rebuild it as section 9 races against the clock to stop

spotted an american empire ballistic missile submarine carrying nuclear warheads off the coast of okinawa the discovery has the tachikoma tanks concerned they cannot hack into the submarine s computerized equipment to determine the vessel s orders and to make matters worse the missiles carried by the submarine are designed to go clear into the stratosphere before returning to earth this revelation means the submarine can hit dejima island from its current location and position and that the missile cannot be traced back to the submarine thereby absolving the american empire from any blame for a nuclear attack the tachikoma tanks believe that the sub is preparing to destroy dejima by launching a warhead at the island which will eliminate not only dejima island and its refugees but also the ground self defense army soldiers stationed in nagasaki and the maritime self defense force cruisers around the island elsewhere batou and the rest of section 9 are heavily pursued by section 4 dispatched by the jgsdf to retrieve the plutonium allegedly possessed by the militant refugees section 9 seems to have the upper hand until batou and the others are cornered by section 4 members in an open air plaza in a bold move batou reveals himself to section 4 and attempts to convince them that they are being set up by a third party since batou s eyes are of the same type that the members of section 4 have the team leader and the other members of the rangers listen to batou as he explains that a submarine is preparing to nuke dejima and section 4 realizes that if the plutonium is not presented to the gsda soon they will launch a full scale military invasion of the island which will provide goda with the scenario he envisioned for a nuclear suicide attack initiated by the refugees wasting no time both section 9 and section 4 head for the bridge with the plutonium at the bridge site the gsda has finally succeeded in erecting a replacement for the section of bridge destroyed earlier unaware of the nuclear threat posed by the american submarine the gsda prepares to invade dejima to pacify it ahead of the expected arrival of the un inspectors elsewhere kusanagi finally locates kuze but both find themselves trapped under rubble following a jmsdf air raid trapped in a warehouse and with missiles and naval gunfire pounding the position kuze explains that his revolution is meant to be a sort of mass migration of the refugees minds into the net and that his ideals and the ideals of the individual eleven virus were enough at odds with each other that he was able to

the football league system l2 level 2 of the football league system stadium chelsea have only had one home ground stamford bridge where they have played since the team s foundation the stadium was officially opened on 28 april 1877 and for the next 28 years it was used by the london athletic club as an arena for athletics meetings in 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman gus mears and his brother joseph who had purchased nearby land formerly a large market garden with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12 5 acre 51 000 m2 site 92 stamford bridge was designed for the mears family by the noted football architect archibald leitch who had designed ibrox craven cottage and hampden park 93 most football clubs were founded first and then sought grounds in which to play but chelsea were founded for stamford bridge starting with an open bowl like design and one grandstand with seating stamford bridge had an original capacity of around 100 000 making it the second biggest stadium in england after crystal palace 92 the early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around 20 of the stand as the roof resembled that of a corrugated iron shed the stand eventually became known as the shed end although it is unknown who first coined this name from the 1960s it became known as the home of chelsea s most loyal and vocal supporters 92 in 1939 another small seated stand was added the north stand which remained until its demolition in 1975 92 in the early 1970s the club s owners announced a modernisation of stamford bridge with plans for a state of the art 50 000 all seater stadium 92 work began in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and ultimately only the east stand was completed the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy the freehold was sold to property developers and the club were under threat of eviction from the stadium 92 following a long legal battle it was not until the mid 1990s that chelsea s future at stamford bridge was secured and renovation work resumed 92 the north west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all seater stands and moved closer to the pitch a process completed by 2001 the east stand was retained from the 1970s development in 1996 the north stand was renamed the matthew harding stand after the club director and benefactor who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier that year 94 chelsea vs west bromwich albion at stamford bridge on 23 september 1905 chelsea won 1 0 when stamford bridge was redeveloped in the bates era many additional features were added to the complex including two millennium copthorne hotels apartments bars restaurants the chelsea megastore and an interactive visitor attraction called chelsea world of sport the intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business but they were less successful than hoped and before the abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the chelsea village brand and refocus on chelsea as a football club however the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of chelsea village or the village the stamford bridge freehold the pitch the turnstiles and chelsea s naming rights are now owned by chelsea pitch owners a non profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders the cpo was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers as a condition for using the chelsea fc name the club has to play its first team matches at stamford bridge which means that if the club moves to a new stadium they may have to change their name 95 chelsea s training ground is located in cobham

between essex and the west indies 106 it was the home stadium of the london monarchs american football team for the 1997 season 107 the previous owner abramovich and the club s then executive board determined that a larger stadium is necessary in order for chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia such as arsenal and manchester united 108 owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines fans can only enter stamford bridge via the fulham road which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations 109 the club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep chelsea at their current home 110 111 but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites including the earls court exhibition centre battersea power station and the chelsea barracks 112 in october 2011 a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which stamford bridge sits was voted down by chelsea pitch owners shareholders 113 in may 2012 the club made a formal bid to purchase battersea power station with a view to developing the site into a new stadium 114 but lost out to a malaysian consortium 115 the club subsequently announced plans to redevelop stamford bridge into a 60 000 seater stadium 116 and in january 2017 these plans were approved by hammersmith and fulham council 117 however on 31 may 2018 the club released a statement saying that the new stadium project had been put on hold indefinitely citing the current unfavourable investment climate 118 in july 2022 it was reported that the club s new owner todd boehly had appointed american architect janet marie smith to oversee the renovation of the stadium 119 identity crest chelsea has had four main crests which all underwent minor variations the first adopted when the club was founded was the image of a chelsea pensioner the army veterans who reside at the nearby royal hospital chelsea this contributed to the club s original pensioner nickname and remained for the next half century though it never appeared on the shirts when ted drake became chelsea manager in 1952 he began to modernise the club believing the chelsea pensioner crest to be old fashioned he insisted that it be replaced 120 a stop gap badge which comprised the initials c f c was adopted for a year in 1953 the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a staff it was based on elements in the coat of arms of the metropolitan borough of chelsea 121 with the lion rampant regardant taken from the arms of then club president viscount chelsea and the staff from the abbots of westminster former lords of the manor of chelsea it featured three red roses to represent england and two footballs 120 this was the first chelsea crest to appear on the shirts in the early 1960s in 1975 a heraldic badge was granted by the college of arms to the english football league for use by chelsea the badge took the form of the familiar lion and staff encircled by a blue ring but without lettering and without the red roses and red footballs blazoned as a lion rampant reguardant azure supporting with the forepaws a crozier or all within an annulet azure 122 in 1986 with ken bates owner of the club chelsea s crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked 123 the new badge featured a more naturalistic non heraldic lion in white and not blue standing over the c f c initials this lasted for the next 19 years with some modifications such as the use of different colours including red from 1987 to 1995 and yellow from 1995 until 1999 before the white returned 124 with the new ownership of roman abramovich and the club s centenary approaching combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005 the new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005 06 season and marked a return to the older design used from 1953 to 1986 featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff for the centenary season this was accompanied by the words 100 years and centenary 2005 2006 on the top and bottom of the crest respectively 125 colours c 1912 126 chelsea s first home colours 1905 chelsea have always worn blue shirts although they originally used the paler eton blue which was taken from the racing colours of then club president earl cadogan and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks 127 the light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912 128 in the 1960s chelsea manager tommy docherty changed the kit again switching to blue shorts which have remained ever since and white socks believing it made the club s colours more modern and distinctive since no other major side used that combination this kit was first worn during the 1964 65 season 129 since then chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992 when blue socks were reintroduced chelsea s away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim more recently the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year 130 as with most teams they have had some more unusual ones at docherty s behest in the 1966 fa cup semi final they wore blue and black stripes based on inter milan s kit 131 in the mid 1970s the away strip was a red white and green kit inspired by the hungarian national side of the 1950s 132 other away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986 to 1989 red and white diamonds from 1990 to 1992 graphite and tangerine from 1994 to 1996 and luminous yellow from 2007 to 2008 130 the graphite and tangerine strip has appeared in lists of the worst football kits ever 133 songs and fan chants the song blue is the colour was released as a single in the build up to the 1972 league cup final with all members of chelsea s first team squad singing it reached number five in the uk singles chart 134 the song has since been adopted by a number of other sports teams around the world including the vancouver whitecaps as white is the colour 135 and the saskatchewan roughriders as green is the colour 136 chelsea released the song no one can stop us now in 1994 for reaching the 1994 fa cup final it reached number 23 in the uk

for cr\u00eapes you are meant to drink cider with your meal and it will come in a tiny bowl called a bol\u00e9e and if you have fearlessly chosen the galette \u00e0 l andouille which is filled with a pungent type of sausage made from pork guts then yes that smell is normal planning tip it is not a given that your local cr\u00eaperie will have an english translated menu be aware that in many parts of the region savory cr\u00eapes are called galettes and they are made with buckwheat it gives them a deliciously nutty smoky taste and also means that they are gluten free a cr\u00eape de froment is
